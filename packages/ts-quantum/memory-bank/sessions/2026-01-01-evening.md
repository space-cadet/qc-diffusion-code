## Focus Task
T6: Native Sparse Operator Support
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Active Tasks
### T6: Native Sparse Operator Support
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Progress**:
1. ✅ Create SparseOperator class implementing IOperator
2. ✅ Implement sparse matrix-vector multiplication (O(nnz))
3. ✅ Implement sparse tensor product
4. ✅ Optimize IdentityOperator and DiagonalOperator
5. ✅ Add density-based auto-optimization in MatrixOperator
6. ✅ Create implementation documentation

## Context and Working State
Developed a native sparse matrix implementation to support high-performance quantum simulations. The `SparseOperator` class provides $O(nnz)$ complexity for core operations. Integrated this into the library's factory methods so users get automatic performance benefits for high-sparsity systems like quantum walks.

## Critical Files
- `src/operators/sparseOperator.ts`: High-performance operator class
- `src/operators/sparse.ts`: Underlying sparse utilities
- `src/operators/operator.ts`: Factory methods and auto-optimization
- `src/operators/specialized.ts`: Identity/Diagonal optimizations
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/sparse-operators.md`: Technical documentation

## Session Notes
- Resolved performance bottlenecks in `qc-diffusion-code` by upstreaming sparse support.
- Library now supports automatic conversion to sparse format for low-density matrices.
- Successfully built and validated the package locally.
