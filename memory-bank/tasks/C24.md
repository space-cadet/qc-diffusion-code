*Last Updated: 2026-01-28 22:11:28 IST*

## Task Overview
Implement comprehensive quantum random walk explorer with parameter specification panel, classical comparison, decoherence logic, and unified styling to match existing application components.

## Status
✅ COMPLETED

## Dependencies
- C5b: Random Walk UI Implementation
- C17: Analysis Dashboard and Plotly Integration

## Progress
1. ✅ Extract CSS from ts-quantum for QuantumWalkPage styling
2. ✅ Extract simulation logic from simulations.ts and simulation-controller.ts into React hooks/utilities
3. ✅ Map HTML structure of qrw-demo.html to React components in QuantumWalkPage.tsx
4. ✅ Fix syntax errors and missing closing tags in QuantumWalkPage.tsx
5. ✅ Update QuantumWalkPage.tsx with sidebar, classical walk, and analysis views
6. ✅ Fix Plotly type errors and coordinate inconsistencies in QuantumWalkPage.tsx
7. ✅ Add missing classical parameters (persistence) and remaining UI controls to Sidebar
8. ✅ Rewire UI events and simulation loop into QuantumWalkPage.tsx
9. ✅ Implement Parameter Specification Panel as in Image 1
10. ✅ Enhance Classical Comparison UI: Split/Overlay modes as in Image 2
11. ✅ Expand Observables Panel: Spread Width, Regime as in Image 3
12. ✅ Implement Decoherence (coin measurement) logic in simulation loop
13. ✅ Final UI styling and layout polish for Image 3 alignment
14. ✅ Apply unified styling to match Random Walk Sim and Analysis pages

## Key Files Modified
- `frontend/src/QuantumWalkPage.tsx` - Main implementation file
- `frontend/src/QuantumWalkPageRefactored.tsx` - Framework-based refactored version
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/quantum-walk-implementation.md` - Documentation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented
- **Parameter Specification Panel**: 3-column grid with lattice size, boundary conditions, decoherence, ensemble size, coin type controls
- **Classical Comparison**: Toggle between overlay and split visualization modes
- **Comprehensive Observables**: Spread width, regime detection, quantum/classical variance comparison
- **Decoherence Logic**: Coin measurement probability with ensemble averaging
- **Unified Styling**: Consistent with RandomWalkParameterPanel and AnalysisPage components

### Simulation Logic
- Quantum walk with Hadamard, Grover, and Rotation coin operators
- Classical walk comparison (Simple and Persistent models)
- Decoherence implementation with probability-based coin measurement
- Real-time variance growth analysis
- Timeline seeking and step-by-step simulation control

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Collapsible sidebar with quick controls
- Multi-view architecture (Visualization, Analysis, Education)
- Responsive layout with proper Tailwind CSS styling
- Interactive timeline slider with step seeking
- Status indicators and real-time metrics display

## Notes
Full implementation completed successfully with all requested features from qrw-demo.html integrated into the React application. The component now provides a comprehensive quantum walk exploration interface with advanced analysis capabilities and consistent styling across the application.
