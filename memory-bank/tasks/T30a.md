## Task Information
**Title:** Overlap Prevention & Initial State Selection for Boundary Growth
**Status:** 🔄
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2026-01-30 23:30:00 IST
**Started:** 2026-01-30 23:30:00 IST
**Completed:** -

## Description
Two enhancements to the boundary growth simulation (T30):
1. **Overlap prevention**: Add toggle to reject new simplices that geometrically overlap existing ones (hard-core repulsion).
2. **Initial state selection**: Allow user to choose starting topology — single simplex or triangle/tet strip (for Cauchy surface evolution per arXiv:1108.1974v2 Fig. 10).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `preventOverlap` boolean parameter in BoundaryGrowthParams
- [ ] 2D triangle-triangle intersection test
- [ ] 3D bounding-sphere overlap check
- [ ] Rejection + retry logic in controller (up to N boundary elements)
- [ ] `initialState` select parameter ('single-simplex' | 'triangle-strip')
- [ ] `stripLength` slider (3-20) for strip mode
- [ ] Triangle strip initializer (zigzag row of N triangles)
- [ ] Tet strip initializer (row of N tetrahedra sharing faces)
- [ ] UI controls in BoundaryGrowthTab
- [ ] Build passes

- **Depends On:** T30
- **Blocks:** -

## Progress Tracking
- 2026-01-30 23:30 IST: Task created, implementation doc written

## Issues and Blockers
- None

## Notes
- Triangle strip forms a Cauchy slice Σ_n for tent-move spacetime evolution
- Overlap detection uses edge-edge intersection + point-in-triangle for 2D; bounding sphere for 3D
- Retry up to 10 boundary elements before skipping a step
