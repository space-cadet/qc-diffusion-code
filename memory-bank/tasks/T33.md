# T33: Boundary Growth - Panel Size, Symmetric Simplices, Boundary Conditions Fix
*Created: 2026-02-16 05:27:33 IST*
*Last Updated: 2026-02-16 05:27:33 IST*

**Description**: Fix three issues in the Simplicial Growth -> Boundary Growth tab: (1) visualization panel too large on desktop, (2) simplices of variable size/shape, (3) bottom-and-sides boundary condition growing in wrong direction.
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: 2026-02-16
**Last Active**: 2026-02-16 05:27:33 IST
**Dependencies**: T30, T30b

## Completion Criteria
- ✅ Panel max-w-2xl applied, canvas reduced to 600x400 in BoundaryGrowthTab
- ✅ symmetricSimplices param added with default true; equilateral/regular placement for 2D and 3D glue
- ✅ getBottomAndSideBoundaries2D axis inversion fixed (minY → maxY for screen y-down)
- ✅ Relative threshold (2% of x-span) replaces hard-coded 0.1px
- ✅ Frozen set dynamically recomputed each step in controller
- ✅ Build passes cleanly

## Related Files
- `frontend/src/lab/types/simplicial.ts` - Added symmetricSimplices field to BoundaryGrowthParams
- `frontend/src/lab/simplicial/operations/BoundaryGrowth.ts` - Fixed axis inversion, relative threshold, symmetric glue params
- `frontend/src/lab/controllers/BoundaryGrowthController.ts` - Dynamic frozen set, symmetric flag forwarding
- `frontend/src/SimplicialGrowthPage.tsx` - Panel size wrapper, symmetricSimplices default + toggle UI

## Progress
1. ✅ Analyzed all three issues
2. ✅ Added symmetricSimplices to BoundaryGrowthParams type
3. ✅ Fixed getBottomAndSideBoundaries2D (maxY + relative threshold)
4. ✅ Added symmetric parameter to glueTriangle2D and glueTetrahedron3D
5. ✅ Updated computeCandidatePosition2D/3D in controller for symmetric mode
6. ✅ Dynamic frozen set recomputation in step()
7. ✅ Panel size fix + toggle checkbox in UI
8. ✅ Build verified, committed and pushed

## Context
- Screen y-axis increases downward: visual bottom = maxY, not minY
- 3D bottom detection uses minZ (z-up convention for tet strips) - no fix needed
- Equilateral triangle apex height from edge midpoint: edgeLen * sqrt(3) / 2
- Regular tetrahedron apex height from face centroid: avgEdgeLen * sqrt(2/3)
- Frozen set was static (computed once at init); now recomputed each step for bottom-and-sides mode
