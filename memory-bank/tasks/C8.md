## Progress
1. ✅ Added getDensityProfile2D method to RandomWalkSimulator
2. ✅ Created useDensityVisualization hook for canvas rendering
3. ✅ Updated DensityComparison component with 2D heatmap display
4. ✅ Implemented density history recording for temporal analysis
5. ✅ Added wavefront speed analysis for telegraph equation verification
6. ✅ Integrated real-time controls (Update, Auto ON/OFF, Recording)

## Context
Density profile calculation enables verification that random walk simulations obey the telegraph equation by:
- Measuring finite wavefront propagation speed
- Tracking density evolution over time
- Comparing measured vs theoretical diffusion parameters
- Visualizing spatial density distribution in real-time

## Implementation Details
- 2D binning with configurable bin size (default 15 units)
- Canvas-based heatmap with blue-to-red color mapping
- Automatic density updates during simulation
- History recording with 100 snapshot limit for memory management
- Center-of-mass tracking for wavefront speed measurement

## Issues Identified
- Numerical artifacts at boundaries due to periodic boundary wrapping
- Extra bin creation causing edge effects
- Normalization issues in density calculation
- Coordinate system misalignment between physics and visualization

## Status
Task completed with working density profile visualization integrated into the random walk interface. Identified boundary artifacts that need further investigation for accurate telegraph equation verification.
