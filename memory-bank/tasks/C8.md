## Progress
1. ✅ Added getDensityProfile2D method to RandomWalkSimulator
2. ✅ Created useDensityVisualization hook for canvas rendering
3. ✅ Updated DensityComparison component with 2D heatmap display
4. ✅ Implemented density history recording for temporal analysis
5. ✅ Added wavefront speed analysis for telegraph equation verification
6. ✅ Integrated real-time controls (Update, Auto ON/OFF, Recording)

## Context
Density profile calculation enables verification that random walk simulations obey the telegraph equation by:
- Measuring finite wavefront propagation speed
- Tracking density evolution over time
- Comparing measured vs theoretical diffusion parameters
- Visualizing spatial density distribution in real-time

## Implementation Details
- 2D binning with configurable bin size (default 15 units)
- Canvas-based heatmap with blue-to-red color mapping
- Automatic density updates during simulation
- History recording with 100 snapshot limit for memory management
- Center-of-mass tracking for wavefront speed measurement

## Issues Identified and Resolved
- ✅ **Coordinate System Misalignment**: GPT5 fixed density profile clustering at corners by correcting coordinate mapping in RandomWalkSimulator initialization
- ✅ **Physics-Canvas Coordinate Flow**: GPT5 ensured proper coordinate conversion: canvas → physics (ParticleManager) → density calculation uses physics coordinates
- ✅ **Distribution Visualization Sync**: Claude 3.5 fixed synchronization ensuring initial particle visualization immediately matches selected distribution pattern
- ✅ **Canvas Size Propagation**: GPT5 added proper canvas size tracking and propagation to ParticleManager for correct coordinate transformations

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All density profile issues resolved. Working 2D density visualization properly integrated with random walk interface. Coordinate system flow corrected, density calculation now shows proper uniform distribution instead of corner clustering. Ready for telegraph equation verification.
