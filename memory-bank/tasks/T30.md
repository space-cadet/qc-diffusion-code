# T30: Boundary Growth Algorithm Implementation
*Created: 2026-01-29 22:37:00 IST*

**Description**: Implement boundary-gluing growth algorithm for simplicial complexes based on arXiv:1108.1974v2. Instead of applying Pachner moves to the interior (which crowds new simplices inside), new simplices are glued onto boundary faces, growing the complex outward. Add as a new tab in the existing Simplicial Growth page.

## Context
The existing simplicial growth (T28) applies Pachner moves to interior simplices, placing new vertices at centroids. The paper arXiv:1108.1974v2 describes growth by gluing simplices onto boundary faces of a Cauchy hypersurface. This induces Pachner moves on the boundary while growing the complex outward. Key operations: single-simplex gluing and tent moves.
