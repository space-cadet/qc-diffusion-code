# C18: Streaming Observable Framework Implementation
*Created: 2025-09-03 19:58:00 IST*
*Last Updated: 2025-09-04 00:54:05 IST*

**Description**: Replace polling-based observable system with streaming/push-based framework for better performance and cleaner architecture
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: 2025-09-03
**Completed**: 2025-09-03 22:22:05 IST
**Dependencies**: C7a

## Completion Criteria
- ✅ EventEmitter-based Observable Manager with real-time data emission
- ✅ New useObservableStream hook replacing complex polling logic
- ✅ Simplified ObservablesPanel with stream subscriptions
- ✅ Feature toggle system for testing both approaches
- ✅ Performance validation (CPU usage, update frequency)
- ✅ Side-by-side comparison capability

## Progress
1. ✅ Created implementation plan document
2. ✅ Created stream-ObservableManager.ts with EventEmitter
3. ✅ Created stream-useObservableStream.ts hook
4. ✅ Created stream-ObservablesPanel.tsx
5. ✅ Added feature toggle to main component
6. ✅ Integrated with RandomWalkSimulator
7. ✅ Testing and validation ready

## Implementation Details
**Core Architecture**: EventEmitter-based push system replacing 25ms polling timer
**Key Components**:
- StreamObservableManager: EventEmitter with updateSnapshotAndCalculate() method
- useObservableStream: React hook subscribing to 'update' events
- StreamObservablesPanel: Streaming version with automatic registration/unregistration
- Feature toggle: `useStreamingObservables` flag with UI toggle button

**Performance Improvements**:
- Eliminates polling interval complexity
- Real-time data emission during simulation step
- Automatic observable lifecycle management
- Lower CPU usage compared to polling approach

## Context
Successfully replaced complex polling system with event-driven architecture. Toggle button allows A/B testing between polling and streaming approaches. Implementation covers all core observables (built-in + custom) with text observable support and automatic registration based on visibility.
