## Task Information
**Title:** Build Performance Optimization and Bundle Size Reduction
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2026-01-19 18:42:30 IST
**Started:** 2026-01-19 18:42:30 IST
**Completed:** 2026-01-19 18:42:30 IST

## Description
Optimize frontend build performance and reduce bundle size through code splitting, lazy loading, and dependency cleanup. Target 40%+ build time reduction and improved initial load performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Code splitting configuration implemented with manual chunks
- [x] Heavy components converted to lazy imports with Suspense
- [x] Unused dependencies removed from package.json
- [x] Build time reduced by 40%+ (verified: 43% improvement)
- [x] Bundle size analysis completed
- [x] Vercel build cache optimization implemented

## Implementation Details
1. **Code Splitting**: Added manual chunk configuration to vite.config.ts for vendor, plotly, three, particles, graph, math, and utils packages
2. **Lazy Loading**: Converted heavy components (PlotComponent, RandomWalkSim, QuantumWalkPage, AnalysisPage, DensityComparison, ParticleCanvas) to lazy imports with Suspense wrappers
3. **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed 8 unused packages (@dnd-kit/*, @heroicons/react, graphology-generators, graphology-types, expr-eval, picocolors)
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Verified 13 chunks instead of 1 massive bundle, largest chunk now 4.9MB (plotly)
5. **Vercel Optimization**: Updated vercel.json with --prefer-frozen-lockfile for better caching

## Related Files
- `frontend/vite.config.ts`: Added manual chunks configuration
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`: Converted to lazy imports with Suspense
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx`: Converted heavy components to lazy loading
- `frontend/package.json`: Removed unused dependencies
- `vercel.json`: Updated install command for cache optimization

## Dependencies
- **Depends On:** C21 (Build and Dependency Vulnerability Resolution)
- **Blocks:** None

## Progress Tracking
- 2026-01-19 18:42:30 IST: Task completed - all optimizations implemented and verified

## Issues and Blockers
- None encountered during implementation

## Notes
- Build time reduced from 1m 10s to 40s (43% improvement)
- Bundle split into 13 chunks vs 1 massive bundle
- Vercel build cache will benefit from dependency reduction
- Plotly remains largest chunk (4.9MB) - future optimization opportunity
