## Completion Criteria
- ✅ Pause button works for WebGL solver
- ✅ Pause button works for WebSocket solver  
- ✅ Resume functionality maintains simulation state
- ✅ UI properly reflects pause/resume state
- ✅ Backend state synchronization implemented

## Progress
1. ✅ Identified pause button had no effect
2. ✅ Analyzed WebGL vs WebSocket handling differences
3. ✅ Implemented backend state persistence during pause
4. ✅ Added proper pause/resume toggle functionality
5. ✅ Updated UI to show dynamic pause/resume text
6. ✅ Added state synchronization messages
7. ✅ Tested functionality across both solver types

## Context
**Issue**: The pause button in simulation controls had no effect - clicking it did nothing to pause the running simulation.

**Root Cause**: 
- WebGL solver had no pause handling in `handlePause()`
- Backend didn't persist simulation parameters during pause
- Frontend/backend state synchronization was missing

**Solution Implemented by Deepseek v3 + Claude 3.7**:
- Backend: Added params storage and pause state toggle with confirmation messages
- Frontend: Fixed handlePause to work with both WebGL and WebSocket
- UI: Simplified button to show "Pause"/"Resume" dynamically
- State: Proper synchronization between frontend and backend

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Reused existing `runAnimation`/`stop` methods for WebGL pause/resume
- Added `params` storage in ConnectionManager for WebSocket resume
- Backend sends "pause_state" messages to confirm state changes
- Removed disabled state from pause button for cleaner UX
