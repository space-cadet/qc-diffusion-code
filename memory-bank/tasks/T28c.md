## Task Information
**Title:** 3D Simplicial Pachner Moves Implementation
**Status:** 🔄 (Active)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2026-01-28 23:57:00 IST
**Started:** 2026-01-28 23:57:00 IST
**Completed:** 

## Description
Implement 3D tetrahedral core with face adjacency maps and Pachner moves (1-4, 2-3, 3-2, 4-1). This includes adjacency queries, move implementations with validation, and geometric quality checks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement tetrahedral structure (TetrahedralStructure.ts)
- [ ] Implement 3D query operations (getTetrahedronFaces, getTetrahedronNeighbors, getFaceTetrahedra)
- [ ] Implement 3D validation (validateTetrahedron, validateManifold3D)
- [ ] Implement 1-4 move with validation (subdivide tetrahedron at centroid)
- [ ] Implement 2-3 move with validation (transform 2 tets to 3 tets)
- [ ] Implement 3-2 move with validation (transform 3 tets to 2 tets)
- [ ] Implement 4-1 move with validation (coarsen 4 tets to 1 tet)
- [ ] Add geometric validation (tetrahedron volume thresholds)
- [ ] Create unit tests for each move
- [ ] Test inverse moves (1-4 then 4-1 should restore)

## Implementation Details
- Face adjacency map enables efficient tetrahedron neighbor queries
- Pure functions for all moves with pre/post validation
- Centroid calculation for 1-4: (v0.x + v1.x + v2.x + v3.x) / 4
- Face adjacency validation for 2-3 move (exactly 2 incident tets)
- 4-1 move must verify closed ball around vertex
- Update vertexCount and vertexPositions appropriately

## Dependencies
- **Depends On:** T28a (simplicial core)
- **Blocks:** T28d (integration)

## Progress Tracking
- 2026-01-28: Task created, documentation complete

## Issues and Blockers
- None

## Notes
- 4-1 move is inverse of 1-4 move (should restore original complex)
- 3-2 move is inverse of 2-3 move
- Current implementation uses only triangular faces, needs explicit tetrahedra
- createInitialVertexPositions returns empty Map for 3D (needs fixing)
