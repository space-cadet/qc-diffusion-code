## Progress
1. âœ… Created new GitHub repository qc-diffusion-code
2. âœ… Used git subtree to extract code directory history from main repo
3. âœ… Copied graph-core and graph-ui packages to eliminate external dependencies
4. âœ… Updated frontend package.json to reference local graph-core package
5. âœ… Created and configured vercel.json for deployment
6. âœ… Fixed vercel.json schema issues and monorepo configuration
7. ðŸ”„ Resolving pnpm lockfile sync issues preventing Vercel build
8. â¬œ Complete successful Vercel deployment
9. â¬œ Verify application functionality in production

## Context
Standalone repository created at https://github.com/space-cadet/qc-diffusion-code with complete commit history from main project. All external dependencies resolved by copying required packages locally. Vercel configuration updated to handle monorepo structure with frontend as build target.

## Current Issues
- pnpm lockfile out of sync after adding local graph-core dependency
- Node version compatibility issues with corepack/pnpm
- Build process needs lockfile regeneration before deployment
