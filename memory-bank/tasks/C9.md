## Progress
1. ✅ Created new GitHub repository qc-diffusion-code
2. ✅ Used git subtree to extract code directory history from main repo
3. ✅ Copied graph-core and graph-ui packages to eliminate external dependencies
4. ✅ Updated frontend package.json to reference local graph-core package
5. ✅ Created and configured vercel.json for deployment
6. ✅ Fixed vercel.json schema issues and monorepo configuration
7. ✅ Resolved pnpm workspace configuration issues
8. ✅ Complete successful Vercel deployment
9. ✅ Verified application functionality in production

## Context
Standalone repository created at https://github.com/space-cadet/qc-diffusion-code with complete commit history from main project. All external dependencies resolved by copying required packages locally. Vercel configuration updated to handle monorepo structure with frontend as build target.

## Final Resolution (2025-08-23 18:49:57 IST)

**Issues Resolved:**
1. **pnpm workspace configuration**: Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml` at repo root to properly wire frontend, backend, and packages/* into unified workspace
2. **Vercel build configuration**: Updated Vercel settings to use repo root with proper workspace-aware commands
3. **Output directory mismatch**: Configured Vercel Output Directory to `frontend/dist` to match Vite's default build output

**Key Changes Made:**
- Added `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with packages: frontend, backend, packages/*
- Added root convenience script: `"build": "pnpm --filter qc-diffusion-frontend build"`
- Removed redundant dependencies from root package.json
- Configured Vercel with Root Directory: repo root, Install: `pnpm install`, Build: `pnpm --filter qc-diffusion-frontend build`, Output: `frontend/dist`

**Deployment Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed to Vercel with full functionality
