## Context

This task implements the complete UI framework for the random walk simulation based on the detailed specification in random-walk-ui-interface.md. The react-grid-layout provides draggable, resizable panels matching the ASCII layout designs. All parameter controls are functional with proper state management, ready for physics engine integration.

**Key Implementation Details**:

- 6-panel grid layout: parameters (3x8), canvas (9x8), density (12x4), history (12x4), replay (8x3), export (4x3)
- Real-time parameter calculations: D = v²/(2λ), mean free path = v/λ, mean wait time = 1/λ
- State management for simulation parameters and control states
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for Layout and component props

**UI Components Implemented**:

- Parameter sliders with range validation and real-time value display
- Simulation control buttons with proper state-dependent behavior
- Status display with color-coded simulation states
- Placeholder areas ready for particle rendering and density charts

**Recent Enhancements (2025-08-21)**:

- **Title-bar Dragging**: Panels now only draggable by title bars using draggableHandle=".drag-handle"
- **State Persistence**: Grid layout parameters now persist across browser refresh via Zustand store
- **Improved UX**: Users can interact with controls without accidentally moving panels

**Major Update (2025-08-23)**:

- ✅ **Grid Layout Persistence**: Claude fixed React Grid Layout panel positions/sizes not persisting between page reloads by adding randomWalkSimLayouts state to Zustand store

- ✅ **Coordinate System Fix**: GPT5 fixed density profile clustering issue by correcting coordinate mapping between physics (-200,200) and canvas (0,canvasWidth) spaces
- ✅ **Visualization Sync**: Claude 3.5 fixed final synchronization issue ensuring initial particle visualization matches selected distribution immediately after initialization
- ✅ **Distribution Sampling**: GPT5 implemented sophisticated samplers including Box-Muller transform for Gaussian, polar coordinates for rings, grid positioning with jitter
- ✅ **Comprehensive State Persistence**: Implemented full simulation state persistence with particle positions, velocities, collision data, density history, and observable data
- ✅ **Auto-Save System**: Added periodic state saving every 2 seconds during simulation and on pause/stop events
- ✅ **State Restoration**: Implemented simulation state restoration on component mount with particle position and physics state recovery
- ✅ **Enhanced Particle Tracking**: Added waitingTime property to Particle interface for complete CTRW state tracking
- ✅ **Real-Time Metrics**: Added updateSimulationMetrics and saveSimulationSnapshot methods for live state management

**Refactoring Progress (2025-08-21 Evening)**:

- ✅ **Component Extraction**: Extracted 6 components from 450-line RandomWalkSim.tsx
- ✅ **ParticleCanvas Integration**: Replaced inline component with imported ParticleCanvas
- ✅ **RandomWalkSimulator Class**: Moved to separate physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts file
- ✅ **Type Definitions**: Created types/simulation.ts for SimulationState interface
- ✅ **Build Fixes**: Resolved TypeScript interface mismatches and import errors
- ✅ **Performance Issue**: ts-particles reinitializes on every parameter change (resolved)
- ✅ **File Size Reduction**: Main file reduced from 450+ lines to ~360 lines (20% smaller)

**Animation Toggle Issue Resolution (2025-08-22 Evening)**:

- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: container.refresh() was clearing manually added particles by resetting container based on options (zero particles)
- ✅ **Solution Implemented**: Replaced destructive container.refresh() with non-destructive container.draw(false)
- ✅ **Physics Decoupling**: Separated physics stepping (controlled by isRunning) from rendering (controlled by showAnimation)
- ✅ **Proper Pause Control**: Particles now freeze in place when paused, physics continues when showAnimation is off
- ✅ **Animation Loop Fix**: Removed duplicate position updates between RandomWalkSim and ParticleCanvas components

**UI Enhancement Session (2025-08-23 Evening)**:

- ✅ **Modern Button Styling**: Replaced basic button styles with shadcn-inspired design including proper hover states, focus rings, clean SVG icons, and professional color scheme (blue/green/amber/red)
- ✅ **Controls Repositioning**: Moved simulation controls (Initialize, Start/Pause, Reset) to top of parameters panel for immediate accessibility without scrolling
- ✅ **Status Display Enhancement**: Integrated status display with controls in clean card layout using colored dots instead of emoji bullets, monospace fonts for counters
- ✅ **Collapsible Sections**: Made Random Walk Strategy, Boundary Conditions, Physics Parameters, and Initial Distribution sections collapsible with chevron indicators and smooth animations
- ✅ **State Management**: Added all UI collapsible states and simulation runtime state (except isRunning) to Zustand store for persistence across page reloads
- ✅ **Enhanced Persistence**: Extended Zustand store to include particle positions, velocities, collision data, density history, and observable data
- ✅ **Auto-Save System**: Implemented periodic state saving (every 2 seconds) during simulation and on pause/stop events
- ✅ **State Restoration**: Added restoration logic to rebuild simulation from stored data on page reload (attempted fix - needs debugging in next session)

**External TypeScript Fixes**:

- ✅ **CTRWStrategy.test.ts**: Added missing `waitingTime: 0` to mock particle object
- ✅ **ParticleManager.ts**: Added `waitingTime: 0` to particle initialization  
- ✅ **simulation.ts**: Updated SimulationState interface with optional persistence properties
- ✅ **Particle.ts**: Added `waitingTime: number` to Particle interface
- ✅ **RandomWalkUsed.tsx**: Fixed particle addition API syntax and closing tag structure

**Final Implementation Status**:

- Modern, accessible UI with professional button styling and improved layout
- Complete simulation state persistence architecture implemented
- All TypeScript type errors resolved across codebase
- Collapsible sections for better space management
- Enhanced user experience with immediate control access

**Performance Optimization Session (2025-08-24)**:

- ✅ **Persistent Observable Settings**: Made observable panel expand/collapse state and all checkbox states (particle count, kinetic energy, momentum components) persistent across page reloads via Zustand store
- ✅ **Persistent Density Settings**: Made density profile auto-update toggle persistent (record history kept as session-specific)
- ✅ **Observable Panel UI Fix**: Fixed panel collapsible behavior - panel now properly shows only header when collapsed instead of maintaining full height with empty content
- ✅ **Vertical Scrolling**: Added overflow-y-auto to observables panel content area for proper scrolling when observable list exceeds panel height
- ✅ **Performance Issue Identification**: Identified excessive re-rendering of ParticleCanvas (60fps) caused by updateSimulationMetrics calls in animation loop triggering React state updates
- ✅ **Render Optimization**: Added React.memo() to ParticleCanvas, memoized simulationState object, moved time/collision tracking to refs
- ✅ **Animation Loop Optimization**: Removed updateSimulationMetrics from frame-by-frame animation loop, added 1-second interval for periodic state sync, only update metrics on pause/resume/reset events

**Known Issues**:

- Observable registration timing issue causing "No observer registered for id: particleCount" error when ParticleCanvas re-render prevention affects useEffect dependencies

**Next Steps**:

- Fix observable registration/unregistration timing issue
- Test performance improvements and ensure stable 60fps without React re-renders
- Complete observable infrastructure for kinetic energy and momentum components
