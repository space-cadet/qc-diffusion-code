## Context

This task implements the complete UI framework for the random walk simulation based on the detailed specification in random-walk-ui-interface.md. The react-grid-layout provides draggable, resizable panels matching the ASCII layout designs. All parameter controls are functional with proper state management, ready for physics engine integration.

**Key Implementation Details**:

- 6-panel grid layout: parameters (3x8), canvas (9x8), density (12x4), history (12x4), replay (8x3), export (4x3)
- Real-time parameter calculations: D = v²/(2λ), mean free path = v/λ, mean wait time = 1/λ
- State management for simulation parameters and control states
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for Layout and component props

**UI Components Implemented**:

- Parameter sliders with range validation and real-time value display
- Simulation control buttons with proper state-dependent behavior
- Status display with color-coded simulation states
- Placeholder areas ready for particle rendering and density charts

- ✅ **Solution Implemented**: Replaced destructive container.refresh() with non-destructive container.draw(false)
- ✅ **Physics Decoupling**: Separated physics stepping (controlled by isRunning) from rendering (controlled by showAnimation)
- ✅ **Proper Pause Control**: Particles now freeze in place when paused, physics continues when showAnimation is off
- ✅ **Animation Loop Fix**: Removed duplicate position updates between RandomWalkSim and ParticleCanvas components

**UI Enhancement Session (2025-08-23 Evening)**:

- ✅ **Modern Button Styling**: Replaced basic button styles with shadcn-inspired design including proper hover states, focus rings, clean SVG icons, and professional color scheme (blue/green/amber/red)
- ✅ **Controls Repositioning**: Moved simulation controls (Initialize, Start/Pause, Reset) to top of parameters panel for immediate accessibility without scrolling
- ✅ **Status Display Enhancement**: Integrated status display with controls in clean card layout using colored dots instead of emoji bullets, monospace fonts for counters
- ✅ **Collapsible Sections**: Made Random Walk Strategy, Boundary Conditions, Physics Parameters, and Initial Distribution sections collapsible with chevron indicators and smooth animations
- ✅ **State Management**: Added all UI collapsible states and simulation runtime state (except isRunning) to Zustand store for persistence across page reloads

**Performance Optimization Session (2025-08-24 by GPT5)**:

- ✅ **Persistent Observable Settings**: Made observable panel expand/collapse state and all checkbox states (particle count, kinetic energy, momentum components) persistent across page reloads via Zustand store
- ✅ **Persistent Density Settings**: Made density profile auto-update toggle persistent (record history kept as session-specific)
- ✅ **Observable Panel UI Fix**: Fixed panel collapsible behavior - panel now properly shows only header when collapsed instead of maintaining full height with empty content
- ✅ **Vertical Scrolling**: Added overflow-y-auto to observables panel content area for proper scrolling when observable list exceeds panel height
- ✅ **Performance Issue Identification**: Identified excessive re-rendering of ParticleCanvas (60fps) caused by updateSimulationMetrics calls in animation loop triggering React state updates
- ✅ **Render Optimization**: Added React.memo() to ParticleCanvas, memoized simulationState object, moved time/collision tracking to refs
- ✅ **Animation Loop Optimization**: Removed updateSimulationMetrics from frame-by-frame animation loop, added 1-second interval for periodic state sync, only update metrics on pause/resume/reset events

**CPU Usage Elimination (2025-08-24)**:

- ✅ **Simulation Status-Gated Animation**: Modified ParticleCanvas to check case-insensitive simulation status - when not "running", draws single static frame and skips requestAnimationFrame loop entirely
- ✅ **tsParticles Internal Ticker Disabled**: Added autoPlay: false to engine.load options and explicit container.pause() to eliminate hidden internal RAF loops
- ✅ **Complete Rendering Control**: Enhanced RandomWalkSim with simReady flag, renderEnabledRef for independent rendering control, visibility change handlers for tab switching
- ✅ **Observable Registration Race Fix**: Added simReady prop and isRegistered local flag to ObservablesPanel to prevent registration before simulator ready and gate polling appropriately
- ✅ **Dependency Optimization**: Removed unnecessary simulatorRef.current from useDensityVisualization effect dependencies
- ✅ **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging to trace effect lifecycle, animation loops, and cleanup events

**Technical Improvements**:
- High CPU usage when paused/stopped completely eliminated
- Both custom RAF and tsParticles internal loops properly disabled in idle states

- ✅ **Internal Header Removal**: Cleaned up ObservablesPanel component by removing internal "Observables" title and collapse toggle to avoid duplicate controls
- ✅ **TypeScript Fixes**: Fixed JSX syntax errors and null safety issues with proper event typing and optional chaining operators
- ✅ **UI Simplification**: Streamlined component to render only observable content sections without internal state management for collapse

**Technical Details**:
- Floating window positioned at top-right with drag handle and resize capabilities
- Single collapse control in window header eliminates UI confusion
- ObservablesPanel now purely content-focused without header/collapse logic
- Proper null checks using `?.` operator for all observable data fields
- Event handlers explicitly typed as `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`

**Final Status**: COMPLETED with comprehensive performance optimization, CPU usage elimination, and floating observables panel

**PDE UI Enhancements (2025-08-25)**:

- ✅ **Input Field Conversion**: Changed negative-capable numeric inputs from type="number" to type="text" to allow intermediate values like "-" during typing
- ✅ **State Management**: Added proper useState and useEffect imports to Controls.tsx for local state management of string inputs

**Component Refactoring (2025-08-25)**:
