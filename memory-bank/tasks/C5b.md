## Context

This task implements the complete UI framework for the random walk simulation based on the detailed specification in random-walk-ui-interface.md. The react-grid-layout provides draggable, resizable panels matching the ASCII layout designs. All parameter controls are functional with proper state management, ready for physics engine integration.

**Key Implementation Details**:

- 6-panel grid layout: parameters (3x8), canvas (9x8), density (12x4), history (12x4), replay (8x3), export (4x3)
- Real-time parameter calculations: D = v²/(2λ), mean free path = v/λ, mean wait time = 1/λ
- State management for simulation parameters and control states
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for Layout and component props

**UI Components Implemented**:

- Parameter sliders with range validation and real-time value display
- Simulation control buttons with proper state-dependent behavior
- Status display with color-coded simulation states
- Placeholder areas ready for particle rendering and density charts

- ✅ **Persistent Density Settings**: Made density profile auto-update toggle persistent (record history kept as session-specific)
- ✅ **Observable Panel UI Fix**: Fixed panel collapsible behavior - panel now properly shows only header when collapsed instead of maintaining full height with empty content
- ✅ **Vertical Scrolling**: Added overflow-y-auto to observables panel content area for proper scrolling when observable list exceeds panel height
- ✅ **Performance Issue Identification**: Identified excessive re-rendering of ParticleCanvas (60fps) caused by updateSimulationMetrics calls in animation loop triggering React state updates

**CPU Usage Elimination (2025-08-24)**:

- ✅ **Simulation Status-Gated Animation**: Modified ParticleCanvas to check case-insensitive simulation status - when not "running", draws single static frame and skips requestAnimationFrame loop entirely
- ✅ **tsParticles Internal Ticker Disabled**: Added autoPlay: false to engine.load options and explicit container.pause() to eliminate hidden internal RAF loops
- ✅ **Complete Rendering Control**: Enhanced RandomWalkSim with simReady flag, renderEnabledRef for independent rendering control, visibility change handlers for tab switching
- ✅ **Observable Registration Race Fix**: Added simReady prop and isRegistered local flag to ObservablesPanel to prevent registration before simulator ready and gate polling appropriately
- ✅ **Dependency Optimization**: Removed unnecessary simulatorRef.current from useDensityVisualization effect dependencies
- ✅ **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging to trace effect lifecycle, animation loops, and cleanup events

**Technical Improvements**:
- High CPU usage when paused/stopped completely eliminated

- Single collapse control in window header eliminates UI confusion
- ObservablesPanel now purely content-focused without header/collapse logic
- Proper null checks using `?.` operator for all observable data fields
