#### 22:43:00 IST - T30: Boundary growth algorithm implementation
- Created `frontend/src/lab/simplicial/operations/BoundaryGrowth.ts` - Boundary detection, outward normal computation, glue and tent move operations for 2D and 3D
- Created `frontend/src/lab/controllers/BoundaryGrowthController.ts` - Controller implementing SimulationController interface for boundary growth
- Created `frontend/src/lab/hooks/useBoundaryGrowth.ts` - React hook managing boundary growth simulation state
- Modified `frontend/src/lab/simplicial/index.ts` - Added boundary growth exports
- Modified `frontend/src/lab/types/simplicial.ts` - Added BoundaryGrowthState, BoundaryGrowthParams, BoundaryMoveType types
- Modified `frontend/src/SimplicialGrowthPage.tsx` - Added TabNavigation with Boundary Growth and Interior Moves tabs
- Created `memory-bank/tasks/T30.md` - Task file for boundary growth algorithm
