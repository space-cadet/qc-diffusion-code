# Boundary Condition Architecture 3-Way Comparison

## Feature Comparison

| Feature               | Claude4 Approach | GPT5 Approach | DeepSeek Approach |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| BC Implementation     | Hybrid (shader + texture wrap) | Shader-only | Shader-only |
| Per-equation BC       | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Per-edge BC           | Yes (immediate) | Phase 3 (optional) | Phase 4 (future) |
| Texture Wrap Reliance | Partial | None | None |
| Shader API            | Multiple helpers | Unified sampling API | Unified sampling API |
| Diagnostics           | Basic | Enhanced | Enhanced with visualization |
| Complexity            | High | Medium | Low |

## Pros and Cons

### Claude4 (Hybrid)
**Pros**:
- Flexible texture configuration
- Clear separation of BC and solver strategies

**Cons**:
- Risk of edge behavior inconsistencies
- More complex implementation

### GPT5 (Shader-only)
**Pros**:
- Single source of truth for edges
- Clear migration path from current state

**Cons**:
- Slightly more GLSL code

### DeepSeek (Optimized)
**Pros**:
- Simplest architecture
- Focused on essential features first
- Best performance characteristics

**Cons**:
- Less flexible for advanced cases

## Recommendation

The DeepSeek shader-only approach provides the best balance of:
1. Implementation simplicity
2. Runtime consistency
3. Performance
4. Gradual extensibility

It avoids the hybrid pitfalls of Claude4 while being more focused than GPT5's solution. The phased implementation matches our KIRSS principles perfectly.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Core BC helpers (Phase 1)
2. Per-equation selection (Phase 2)
3. Diagnostics (Phase 3)
4. Advanced controls (Phase 4+)
