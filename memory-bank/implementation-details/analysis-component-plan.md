## Overview
Implementation of a dedicated Analysis tab for advanced plotting and data analysis of simulation results using Plotly.js integration and React Grid Layout.

## Completed Tasks (Session 2025-09-01-night)

### Phase 1: Tab Infrastructure ✅
- Created `AnalysisPage.tsx` component with React Grid Layout
- Added Analysis tab to App.tsx navigation
- Integrated tab routing with existing system

### Phase 2: Basic Grid Layout ✅
- Implemented 4-panel layout:
  - Data Import panel (simulation data connection)
  - Plot Configuration panel (chart type, axes selection)
  - Plot Display panel (Plotly chart rendering)
  - Export Controls panel (format selection, data export)
- Added draggable/resizable panels with drag handles
- State management for grid layouts

### Phase 3: Plotly Integration ✅
- Created PlotlyChart.tsx wrapper component
- Integrated plotly.js directly (bypassed React wrapper issues)
- Added sample data demonstration
- Implemented responsive chart rendering

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
```
AnalysisPage
├── Panel (reusable wrapper)
├── DataImportPanel (simulation data connection)
├── PlotConfigPanel (chart configuration)
├── PlotDisplayPanel (PlotlyChart integration)
└── ExportControlsPanel (data export tools)
```

### Key Features Implemented
- React Grid Layout with responsive breakpoints
- Drag handle isolation for clean UI interaction
- Plotly.js direct integration with useEffect rendering
- Sample data visualization with line plots
- Panel collapse/expand functionality
- Modern Tailwind CSS styling

### Dependencies Added
- `plotly.js`: Direct plotting library
- `react-plotly`: React wrapper (existing)
- Grid layout and resizable components (existing)

## Next Steps (Future Implementation)

### Phase 4: Data Pipeline
- Connect to existing simulation stores (appStore.ts)
- Implement real-time data sync from Random Walk simulation
- Add data transformation utilities for Plotly format
- Create analysis data store with Zustand

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Multiple chart types (histogram, heatmap, 3D plots)
- Data export functionality (CSV, JSON, PNG, PDF)
- Analysis calculations (MSD, autocorrelation, etc.)
- Custom plot styling and themes

### Phase 6: Performance Optimization
- Large dataset handling
- Real-time plot updates
- Memory management for continuous simulations
- WebGL acceleration for complex visualizations

## File Structure
```
frontend/src/components/
├── AnalysisPage.tsx          # Main analysis interface
└── PlotlyChart.tsx           # Plotly.js wrapper component
```

## Session Outcomes
- Analysis tab fully functional with navigation
- Basic plotting capability demonstrated
- Clean, professional UI matching existing design
- Foundation ready for advanced features
- Zero disruption to existing simulation functionality
