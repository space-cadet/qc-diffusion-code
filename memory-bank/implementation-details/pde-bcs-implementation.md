## Overview

This document records the implementation of boundary conditions in the WebGL PDE solver, focusing on Dirichlet boundary conditions and solver-agnostic enforcement.

## Implementation Strategy

### Dirichlet Boundary Conditions Implementation ✅

1. **Type Definitions**
   - Used existing `BoundaryConditionType` union type ('neumann' | 'dirichlet')
   - Used existing `SimulationParams` interface with `boundaryCondition` and `dirichlet_value` fields

2. **WebGL Solver Integration**
   - Updated `WebGLSolver.init` signature to include BC parameters:
     ```typescript
     init(width: number, height: number, bcType?: BoundaryConditionType, dirichletValue?: number): void;
     ```
   - Modified `createTextures()` to accept and use BC parameters
   - Stored BC type and Dirichlet value on solver instance for later use

3. **Solver-Agnostic Approach**
   - Implemented post-processing pass after solver step to enforce Dirichlet BCs
   - Created `getEnforceDirichletProgram()` with shader that overwrites boundary columns
   - Applied after any solver step when `bcType === 'dirichlet'`
   - This approach requires no changes to individual solvers

4. **Forward Euler Fix**
   - Fixed Forward Euler solver by adding missing `gl.drawArrays` call
   - Ensured proper rendering before Dirichlet enforcement pass
   - Resolved issue where solution collapsed to zero except at boundaries

### UI Components ✅

- **PlotComponent.tsx**: 
  - Enhanced plot with solver and parameter information in the legend
  - Each equation's legend entry now includes solver name and parameters
  - Format: `Equation Name<br><span style="font-size:11px;color:#666">Solver, params</span>`
  - Moved legend to the right side of the plot for better visibility

### Technical Implementation

1. **Dirichlet Enforcement Shader**
   ```glsl
   void main() {
     vec2 texel = 1.0 / vec2(textureSize(textureSource, 0));
     vec4 v = texture(textureSource, textureCoords);
     if (textureCoords.x - texel.x < 0.0 || textureCoords.x + texel.x > 1.0) {
       v.r = dirichlet_value;
     }
     fragColor = v;
   }
   ```

2. **Post-Processing Approach**
   ```javascript
   // After solver step, if using Dirichlet BCs
   if (this.bcType === 'dirichlet') {
     const enforceProgram = this.getEnforceDirichletProgram();
     // Bind framebuffer, program, textures
     // Set dirichlet_value uniform
     // Draw full-screen quad to enforce BCs
     this.renderQuad();
     // Update current texture index
   }
   ```

## Technical Architecture

### Implemented Architecture

```
UI Layer (✅ Complete)
├── BC type display in plot annotations
└── Solver and parameter info in plot legend

WebGL Integration (✅ Complete)
├── WebGLSolver.init with BC parameters
├── Texture wrapping based on BC type
├── Post-processing pass for Dirichlet enforcement
└── Forward Euler fix for proper rendering
```

### User Experience

Users can now:
- See current BC settings displayed on plots
- View solver type and parameters in the legend
- Run simulations with Dirichlet boundary conditions
- Use any solver (Forward Euler, Crank-Nicolson, Lax-Wendroff) with Dirichlet BCs

The boundary conditions are now properly enforced in the PDE solution through a post-processing pass.

## Implementation Details

### Dirichlet BC Enforcement

The implementation uses a post-processing approach that runs after any solver step:

1. Each solver performs its normal update step
2. If using Dirichlet BCs, a post-processing pass runs that:
   - Reads the current solution texture
   - Overwrites boundary columns with the Dirichlet value
   - Writes the result to a new texture
3. This approach is solver-agnostic and cleanly separates BC enforcement

### Forward Euler Fix

The Forward Euler solver was fixed by adding a missing draw call:

```typescript
// In ForwardEulerSolver.step()
gl.activeTexture(gl.TEXTURE0);
gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, readTexture);
if (uniforms.textureSource) gl.uniform1i(uniforms.textureSource, 0);
// Added missing draw call to render the updated field
gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4);
```

This ensures the solver actually renders its updated field before the Dirichlet enforcement pass.

### Future Enhancements

- Extend Dirichlet enforcement to y-boundaries if needed
- Optimize enforcement pass to avoid extra ping-pong if performance is critical
- Add UI for boundary condition selection
- Support additional BC types (Periodic, Absorbing)

## Future Enhancements for True Modularity (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

To make the PDE boundary condition implementation truly modular, the following changes would be required:

1.  **Complete the Boundary Condition Classes:**
    *   Flesh out the `DirichletBC.ts` and `NeumannBC.ts` classes, and create new classes for other boundary conditions like `RobinBC`.
    *   Each class should extend `BaseBoundaryCondition.ts` and implement the necessary methods to provide its specific GLSL shader code, set any required uniforms, and handle any post-processing passes. The `getShaderCode()` method in each class would return the specific GLSL code for that boundary condition.

2.  **Refactor the Shader Generation:**
    *   Modify the `simulation_shaders.js` file to remove the hardcoded boundary condition logic from the main shader generation functions.
    *   Instead, the main shader code should have a placeholder (e.g., a special comment or a function call) where the boundary condition shader code can be injected.

3.  **Update the `WebGLSolver`:**
    *   Modify the `WebGLSolver` to accept a `BaseBoundaryCondition` object as a parameter during initialization.
    *   The `WebGLSolver` would then call the `getShaderCode()` method on the provided boundary condition object to get the appropriate GLSL code and inject it into the main shader before compilation.
    *   The solver would also call the other methods on the boundary condition object (e.g., `applyBoundaries`, `applyPostPass`) at the appropriate times in the rendering loop.

4.  **Update the `useWebGLSolver` Hook:**
    *   In the `initSolver` function within `useWebGLSolver.ts`, you would instantiate the correct boundary condition class based on the user's selection (e.g., `new DirichletBC(params.dirichlet_value)`).
    *   This boundary condition object would then be passed to the `WebGLSolver` during its initialization.

By implementing these changes, you would decouple the `WebGLSolver` from the specific boundary condition implementations. This would allow you to add new boundary conditions simply by creating a new class, without needing to modify the core solver or shader logic, thus achieving true modularity.

### Advisory notes and phased plan (GPT-5)

- **Advisability**
  - Proceed to a BC-class abstraction if adding more BCs soon (Periodic, Absorbing/Robin) or planning 2D; it decouples solvers from BC logic and scales better.
  - If staying with Neumann + Dirichlet short term, current post-pass is simple and adequate; defer full modularity.

- **Suitability**
  - Fits the current architecture: solvers already generate shader source, and `useWebGLSolver()`/store carry BC params. A `BaseBoundaryCondition` that supplies GLSL snippets/uniforms/post-pass hooks integrates cleanly.

- **Feasibility**
  - Implement via a single sampling abstraction (e.g., `sampleWithBC(...)`) injected into `RDShaderTop/Main/Bot`, plus optional `applyPostPass()` for cases like Dirichlet clamp.
  - Centralize texture creation/wrapping; standardize channel layout to avoid divergence across modules.
  - Ensure uniform/program management handles runtime BC changes (recompile vs dynamic uniforms). Post-pass adds bandwidth but is fine for 1D.

- **Immediate technical issues to address**
  - Duplicate `createSolver` in `frontend/src/webgl/webgl-solver.js` — keep one.
  - Texture format mismatch: `BaseSolver.createBoundaryTextures` uses `RG32F` while `WebGLSolver` uses `RGBA32F`. Choose one (consistent channel usage) and consolidate creation.
  - `BaseSolver.createBoundaryTextures` is currently unused by `WebGLSolver` — either wire it in or remove it.
  - Dirichlet enforcement is x-only — decide whether y-boundaries are required now.

- **Pragmatic, staged recommendation**
  1) Short term: keep post-pass Dirichlet; fix duplicate factory, standardize texture format/creation, and add y-boundary support if needed.
  2) When adding more BCs/2D: introduce `BaseBoundaryCondition` interface with `getSamplingGLSL()`, `setUniforms()`, `applyPostPass()`; implement `Neumann` and `Dirichlet` first, then `Periodic`; inject `sampleWithBC` into shaders; construct BC class in `useWebGLSolver` and pass to `WebGLSolver`.

- **Overall verdict**
  - The modular BC system is suitable and feasible. Adopt it when expanding BC coverage or dimensionality; otherwise, the current solver-agnostic post-pass remains a solid minimal approach.

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Solver-Agnostic Design**: BC enforcement works with any solver implementation
2. **Clean Separation**: BC enforcement is separate from solver logic
3. **Minimal Changes**: No need to modify individual solver shaders
4. **Improved Visualization**: Enhanced plot legend with solver and parameter info
5. **Fixed Forward Euler**: Resolved issue with Forward Euler solver under Dirichlet BCs
