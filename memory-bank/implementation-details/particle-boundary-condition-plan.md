## Overview

Unified boundary condition system for particle simulations that eliminates code duplication across physics strategies and provides consistent boundary behavior.

## Architecture

### Core Components

**BoundaryManager Class**
- Single responsibility: Apply boundary conditions to particles
- Wraps existing `boundaryUtils` functions (periodic, reflective, absorbing)
- Centralizes boundary configuration management
- Provides consistent interface across all strategies

**Integration Points**
- Physics strategies receive `BoundaryManager` instance instead of managing boundaries directly
- All strategies call `boundaryManager.apply(particle)` instead of individual `applyBoundaryCondition()` methods
- Configuration updates flow through `BoundaryManager.updateConfig()`

### Implementation Details

**File Structure**
```
frontend/src/physics/
├── core/BoundaryManager.ts          # Central boundary manager
├── utils/boundaryUtils.ts           # Existing utility functions (unchanged)
├── strategies/                      # Updated strategy files
│   ├── CTRWStrategy2D.ts           # Uses BoundaryManager
│   ├── CTRWStrategy1D.ts           # Uses BoundaryManager  
│   └── BallisticStrategy.ts        # Uses BoundaryManager
```

**Code Changes**
- Replaced `private boundaryConfig` with `private boundaryManager` in all strategies
- Removed duplicate `applyBoundaryCondition()` methods (8+ files)
- Centralized boundary updates through `setBoundaries()` interface
- Added minimal logging for boundary configuration changes

## Benefits

**Code Reduction**
- Eliminated ~15-20 lines of duplicate boundary code per strategy file
- Removed 8+ individual `applyBoundaryCondition()` implementations
- Single source of truth for boundary logic

**Consistency**
- All strategies use identical boundary application logic
- Uniform behavior across different physics strategies
- Centralized configuration management

**Maintainability**
- Boundary improvements only need to be made in one place
- Easier to debug boundary-related issues
- Clear separation of concerns

## Current Status

**Completed**
- BoundaryManager class implementation
- Integration with CTRWStrategy2D, CTRWStrategy1D, BallisticStrategy  
- Code deduplication across strategy files
- Basic logging for configuration changes

**Remaining**
- Integration with remaining strategy files (InterparticleCollision*, LegacyStrategies)
- Boundary visualization system
- Performance optimization for high particle counts
- Advanced boundary types (mixed, shaped, dynamic)

## Validation

Boundary conditions are working but validation needed:
- Visual confirmation that periodic boundaries wrap particles correctly
- Reflective boundaries reverse velocity appropriately  
- Absorbing boundaries remove particles at boundaries
- Performance impact assessment with large particle counts

## Future Enhancements

- Visual boundary indicators on canvas
- Runtime boundary type switching
- Custom boundary shapes (circular, polygonal)
- Performance optimizations (spatial partitioning for boundary checks)
