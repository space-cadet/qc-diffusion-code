## Overview
Replace polling-based observable system with streaming/push-based framework for better performance and cleaner architecture.

## Core Architecture Changes

### 1. Observable Manager Enhancement
- Add EventEmitter capability to existing observable manager
- Emit data during simulation step (not separate polling)
- Events: `observable:update`, `observable:register`, `observable:unregister`

### 2. New React Hook: `useObservableStream`
- Replace `useObservablesPolling` entirely
- Subscribe to observable events via EventEmitter
- Handle cleanup automatically
- ~50 lines vs current 140

### 3. ObservablesPanel Simplification
- Remove all polling logic and complex state tracking
- Simple subscription to data streams
- Registration logic remains but no timing complexity
- ~150 lines vs current 285

## Implementation Strategy - Test Files with stream- Prefix

### New Files for Testing

1. **`physics/stream-ObservableManager.ts`**
   - Copy existing ObservableManager, add EventEmitter capability
   - ~Current size + 30 lines

2. **`components/stream-useObservableStream.ts`**
   - New streaming hook to replace polling logic
   - ~50 lines

3. **`components/stream-ObservablesPanel.tsx`**
   - Copy current ObservablesPanel, modify to use streaming
   - ~150 lines (vs current 285)

4. **`physics/stream-RandomWalkSimulator.ts`** (optional)
   - Copy simulator with observable update integration
   - Or modify existing with feature flag

### Integration Strategy
- Add props to main component to switch between polling/streaming panels
- Keep existing files untouched during testing
- Feature flag or environment variable to toggle systems

### Testing Approach
- Side-by-side comparison of both panels
- Verify data consistency between systems
- Performance comparison (CPU usage, update frequency)
- Test edge cases (rapid start/stop, multiple observables)

### Rollback Safety
- Original files completely preserved
- Simple prop change to revert
- No risk to existing functionality

## Key Benefits
- Eliminates all interval/timing complexity
- Real-time updates (no polling lag)
- Lower CPU usage
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Both observable systems still supported

## Risk Level
Medium - requires coordination between simulation loop and React components, but conceptually simpler than current approach.

## Implementation Order
1. ✅ Create stream-ObservableManager.ts with EventEmitter
2. ✅ Create stream-useObservableStream.ts hook
3. ✅ Create stream-ObservablesPanel.tsx
4. ✅ Add feature toggle to main component
5. ✅ Test and compare both systems
6. ✅ Integration testing and validation
7. ✅ Implementation completed

## Implementation Results (2025-09-03 22:22:05 IST)

### Completed Architecture
**EventEmitter-Based Streaming**: Successfully replaced polling intervals with push-based updates during simulation step. Observables emit data via EventEmitter when particles update, eliminating timing complexity.

**Feature Toggle System**: Added `useStreamingObservables` flag in appStore with UI toggle button. Users can switch between "POLL" and "STREAM" modes for A/B testing and performance comparison.

**Performance Improvements**: 
- Eliminates all interval/timing complexity from polling system
- Real-time updates with no polling lag
- Lower CPU usage through event-driven architecture
- Cleaner separation of concerns between simulation loop and UI

### Technical Implementation Summary
- **StreamObservableManager** (120 lines): EventEmitter-based manager with updateSnapshotAndCalculate()
- **useObservableStream** (25 lines): React hook with event subscriptions replacing polling logic
- **StreamObservablesPanel** (147 lines): Simplified streaming panel with automatic registration
- **Integration**: Conditional manager instantiation in RandomWalkSimulator based on framework flag
- **UI Toggle**: Button in page header switches between polling and streaming observable panels

### Benefits Achieved
- **Architecture**: Event-driven data flow with cleaner separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Real-time updates without polling overhead
- **Testing**: Side-by-side comparison capability between polling and streaming
- **Maintainability**: Simplified observable panel logic (~147 vs 285 lines)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing polling system preserved and functional
