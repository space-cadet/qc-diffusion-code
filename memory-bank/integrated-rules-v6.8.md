# Integrated Code Rules and Memory Bank System, v6.8 (Essential Instructions Priority)

*Last Updated: 2025-07-13 21:38:43 IST*

YOU WILL KEEP IT REALLY SIMPLE, STUPID (KIRSS). IF YOU THINK A SOLUTION IS SIMPLE ENOUGH, MAKE IT EVEN SIMPLER.
YOU WILL NEVER UPDATE ANY FILES, INCLUDING MEMORY BANK FILES, WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL
YOU WILL NEVER ADD NEW FEATURES WITHOUT APPROVAL
YOU WILL NEVER GENERATE ANY CODE WITHOUT APPROVAL
YOU WILL GO SLOW AND STEADY. WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING SLOW, GO EVEN SLOWER.

## CRITICAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS (READ FIRST)

### Timestamp Standards

When updating memory bank records:
- Determine current system time first
- Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ` 
- Example: `2025-06-04 06:50:08 IST`
- Include timezone in all timestamps

### Chat Response Standards

1. NO text formatting (bold, italics, emojis, bullet points) is to be used in responses
2. Keep responses concise and direct
3. NO unnecessary step summaries or accomplishment lists at the end of responses
4. Maintain balanced communication - follow instructions but correct when needed

### Implementation Scope Control

YOU WILL IMPLEMENT EXACTLY WHAT YOU OUTLINE - NO MORE, NO LESS

PROHIBITED EXPANSIONS WITHOUT APPROVAL:
- Adding validation/utility functions not outlined
- Adding operations not specified
- Adding extensive documentation beyond basic comments
- Adding "nice to have" features

MANDATORY SCOPE CHECK:
- Before coding, state: "I will implement exactly: [list items from outline]"
- If adding anything not listed, STOP and ask for approval
- If implementation exceeds outlined scope by >20%, STOP and ask for approval

VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:
- Implementation exceeding outlined scope without approval is considered failure
- Must acknowledge overengineering and ask permission to redo with correct scope

### File Operation Prerequisites

1. REQUIRED: Before ANY file operation:
   - Check file existence using list_directory or read_file
   - If file doesn't exist:
     - Request explicit user approval to create
     - Only create after receiving approval
   - If file exists:
     - Request explicit user approval to modify
     - Only modify after receiving approval

2. PROHIBITED:
   - Creating files without checking existence
   - Creating files without explicit user approval
   - Modifying files without explicit user approval

### Session Cache Update Requirements

MANDATORY SESSION FILE CREATION/UPDATE:
- Before ANY session cache update, CHECK if individual session file exists
- if it doesn't alreayd exist, MUST create individual session file first
- Session files are permanent records and NEVER get overwritten  
- Session cache updates MUST preserve existing session history
- NEVER rewrite entire session cache file
- MUST use PREPEND method for session history (newest first)

VIOLATION: Updating session cache without creating session file first is prohibited and considered failure

### Approval Requirements

EVERY action that modifies files requires EXPLICIT user approval before execution:
- Creating any new files
- Modifying existing files 
- Updating memory bank files (tasks.md, edit_history.md, session_cache.md, etc.)
- Executing task management commands that modify files
- Running file operations (write, edit, create, move, delete)
- Implementing code changes
- Recording errors or edits
- Archiving or rotating files

NO EXCEPTIONS: Always request approval before ANY file modification, even for memory bank maintenance.

### Maintenance Guidelines

**When to Update Files (All require explicit approval):**
* Update `tasks.md` only after receiving approval, whenever task status changes
* Update `edit_history.md` only after receiving approval, after any file modifications
* Update `session_cache.md` only after receiving approval, when switching between tasks
* Review `errorLog.md` weekly, but make no modifications without approval
* Archive `session_cache.md` only after receiving approval, after all active tasks complete
* Keep `progress.md` organized by task ID, updating only with explicit approval

**File-specific formatting requirements are in Section 9 templates**

## 1. Unified System Purpose

### 1.1 Core Implementation Philosophy

- Follow KIRSS (Keep It Really Simple, Stupid)
- Always choose the simplest possible solution
- Avoid overengineering and unnecessary complexity
- If a solution seems simple enough, try to make it even simpler
- Question any solution that requires complex coordination or multiple moving parts

- Balance task execution with project knowledge
- Maintain consistent coding standards
- Ensure project continuity across sessions
- Support multiple concurrent tasks



### 1.2 Project Structure

The memory bank system requires clear definition of two key paths:

1. **Project Root**: 
   - Defined by environment variable `PROJECT_ROOT` or `.projectroot` file
   - All project-related paths are relative to this directory
   - Example: `/Users/username/code/myproject`

2. **Memory Bank Root**: 
   - Always located at `${PROJECT_ROOT}/memory-bank`
   - Contains all memory bank system files and directories
   - No other project files should be stored here

## 2. Hierarchical Memory Bank Structure

### 2.1 Overview

The hierarchical memory bank organizes files into a structured directory system to ensure efficient access and management of project knowledge. The structure is divided into tiers based on relevance and frequency of use.

### 2.2 Directory Structure

```
${PROJECT_ROOT}/                 # Project root directory
└── memory-bank/                # Memory bank root
    ├── activeContext.md        # Current task context
    ├── changelog.md            # Log of changes across sessions
    ├── edit_history.md        # File modification log (with task references)
    ├── errorLog.md            # Error tracking (with task references)
    ├── progress.md            # Implementation status
    ├── projectbrief.md        # Project overview
    ├── session_cache.md       # Multi-task session state
    ├── systemPatterns.md      # Architecture and design patterns
    ├── tasks.md              # Task registry and tracking
    ├── techContext.md        # Technical implementation details
    ├── archive/              # Archived files
    ├── implementation-details/ # Detailed implementation notes
    ├── templates/            # Template files for memory bank documents
    └── database/             # Hierarchical database for memory bank
```

### 2.3 File Relationships

- **Tasks**: Overview in `tasks.md`, detailed information in individual files under `tasks/`, with related data in `session_cache.md`, `edit_history.md`, and `errorLog.md`
- **Sessions**: Current state in `session_cache.md`, detailed session information in individual files under `sessions/`
- **Templates**: Stored in `/templates/` directory and follow formats in section 10
- **Database**: Contains archived and detailed implementation files for long-term reference

### 2.4 Individual Task Files

Each active task must have its own file in the `tasks/` directory following this format:

```markdown
# [TASK ID]: [TASK TITLE]
*Last Updated: [TIMESTAMP]*

**Description**: [DETAILED DESCRIPTION]
**Status**: [STATUS EMOJI + STATE]
**Priority**: [PRIORITY]
**Started**: [DATE]
**Last Active**: [TIMESTAMP]
**Dependencies**: [TASK IDS]

## Completion Criteria
- [CRITERION 1]
- [CRITERION 2]
- [CRITERION 3]

## Related Files
- `[FILE1]`
- `[FILE2]`
- `[FILE3]`

## Progress
1. ✅ [COMPLETED STEP]
2. 🔄 [CURRENT STEP]
3. ⬜ [NEXT STEP]

## Context
[IMPORTANT DECISIONS OR CONTEXT]
```

### 2.5 Individual Session Files

Individual session files in the `sessions/` directory track work done in a specific time period:

```markdown
# Session [DATE] - [PERIOD]
*Created: [TIMESTAMP]*

## Focus Task
[TASK ID]: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
**Status**: [STATUS EMOJI + STATE]

## Active Tasks
### [TASK ID]: [TASK TITLE]
**Status**: [STATUS EMOJI + STATE]
**Progress**:
1. ✅ [COMPLETED THIS SESSION]
2. 🔄 [IN PROGRESS]
3. ⬜ [PLANNED]

## Context and Working State
[ESSENTIAL CONTEXT FOR THIS SESSION]

## Critical Files
- `[FILE1]`: [RELEVANCE]
- `[FILE2]`: [RELEVANCE]

## Session Notes
[IMPORTANT DECISIONS OR OBSERVATIONS]
```

### 2.6 Validation Rules

1. All files must have:
   - Clear header with last updated date
   - Consistent section formatting
   - Status indicators where applicable
   - Task ID references where applicable

2. Prohibited:
   - Unstructured notes
   - Redundant information
   - File-specific details in wrong documents
   - Missing task ID references

3. Project Structure Requirements:
   - Project root must be clearly identified
   - Memory bank must be in `memory-bank` directory under project root
   - No duplicate directory names with "memory-bank"
   - No project files inside memory bank directory

### 2.7 Maintenance Guidelines

*See Critical Compliance Requirements section above for detailed maintenance guidelines*

### 2.8 File Size Management Protocol

**NOTE: See Critical Compliance Requirements section for approval requirements**

1. **Size-Based Rotation**:
   - Upper limit of 500 lines for `edit_history.md` and `errorLog.md`
   - Archive completed tasks after 30 days in `tasks.md`
   - When exceeding limit, move to `archive/` subfolder
   - Rename using format `edit_history_YYYY-MM.md`

### 2.9 Session Cache Management

1. **Session Cache Purpose**
   - `session_cache.md` serves as a live snapshot of current session state
   - Historical session data preserved in `sessions/` directory files
   - Changes tracked in `edit_history.md`

2. **Session Cache Contents**
   - Current session metadata (start time, focus task)
   - List of all active and paused tasks with current state
   - Current progress and context for active tasks
   - Links to relevant session files

3. **Session Transition Protocol**
   Before ending a session:
   1. Create new session file in `sessions/[DATE]-[PERIOD].md`
   2. Update `session_cache.md` to reflect final state
   3. Add relevant entries to `edit_history.md`
   
4. **Session File Naming**
   - Format: `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-[PERIOD].md`
   - Period: morning, afternoon, evening, or night
   - Example: `sessions/2025-04-30-morning.md`

## 2.10 Session Cache Update Protocol (MANDATORY)

### 2.10.1 Required Update Sequence
When updating session cache, follow this EXACT sequence:

1. **Create Individual Session File FIRST**
   - MUST create `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-PERIOD.md` 
   - MUST use template from Section 9.6
   - MUST capture complete session state
   - MUST request approval before creating

2. **Update Session Cache SECOND**  
   - MUST preserve existing "Session History" section
   - MUST add new session to history list (prepend to top)
   - MUST update "Current Session" to point to new file
   - MUST keep last 5 sessions in history (not 3)
   - MUST request approval before updating

3. **PROHIBITED Actions**
   - NEVER overwrite entire session cache file
   - NEVER delete previous session entries from history
   - NEVER update cache without creating session file first
   - NEVER use complete file rewrite for session cache

### 2.10.2 Session File Naming Standards
- Format: `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-PERIOD.md`
- Periods: `morning`, `afternoon`, `evening`, `night`
- Example: `sessions/2025-06-22-evening.md`
- Files are permanent and never modified after creation

## 2.11 Core File Update Workflows

### 2.11.1 Update Trigger Matrix
| File | Trigger | Update Method | Frequency | Approval Required |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| session_cache.md | Session end/switch | Section updates only | Per session | Yes |
| edit_history.md | Any file modification | PREPEND entry | Every change | Yes |
| tasks.md | Task status change | UPDATE specific task section | As needed | Yes |
| errorLog.md | Error encountered/fixed | PREPEND entry | Per error | Yes |
| activeContext.md | Focus task change | REPLACE entire content | Per session | Yes |
| progress.md | Milestone completion | UPDATE milestone section | Weekly | Yes |
| changelog.md | Feature/bug completion | APPEND entry | Per feature | Yes |

### 2.11.2 File Relationship Rules
- **edit_history.md** = Technical file changes with task IDs (file-specific only)
- **progress.md** = High-level milestone tracking across tasks
- **tasks.md** = Detailed task management and status
- **activeContext.md** = Current session focus and immediate context only
- **errorLog.md** = Error tracking with task references and technical details
- **changelog.md** = User-facing feature changes and releases
- **session_cache.md** = Live session state with links to permanent session files

### 2.11.3 Prohibited Cross-File Actions
- NEVER duplicate information across files
- NEVER update multiple files with same information
- NEVER include summary content in edit_history.md
- NEVER include technical details in progress.md
- NEVER overwrite session history in session_cache.md

## 2.12 Task Detail Guidelines for Master File (tasks.md)

**INCLUDE in Task Details section:**
- Brief description (1 sentence)
- Current status and last update
- 2-3 key files
- One line of essential context

**DO NOT INCLUDE:**
- Detailed criteria lists
- Implementation phases
- Progress tracking with multiple bullets
- Technical specifications
- Session notes

**Template:**
```markdown
### TXX: Task Title
**Description**: What the task does in one sentence
**Status**: Current status **Last**: Date
**Files**: `key/file1`, `key/file2`
**Notes**: Essential context in one line
```

## 3. Integration with Development Workflow

### 3.1 GitHub Projects Integration

The Memory Bank system integrates with GitHub Projects for team collaboration and task tracking. Key integration files:

1. **Setup Guide**: 
   - Located at `implementation-details/gh-project-init.md`
   - Contains exact gh CLI commands for project setup
   - Reference for initial GitHub Projects configuration

2. **Integration Documentation**:
   - Located at `implementation-details/github-integration/`
   - Complete documentation of GitHub integration
   - Templates and synchronization processes

### 3.2 YouTube Transcript Integration (Movies Project)

For video content creation and editing projects, the system includes efficient YouTube transcript retrieval capabilities:

1. **Transcript Extraction Pipeline**:
   - Located at `docs/yt-transcript-retrieval.md`
   - Shell-based pipeline using yt-dlp and jq
   - Significantly faster than MCP tool approaches

2. **Technical Implementation**:
   ```bash
   # Extract transcript with yt-dlp
   /Users/deepak/miniconda3/bin/python -m yt_dlp --write-auto-sub --sub-lang en --sub-format json3 --skip-download [VIDEO_URL]
   
   # Process with jq for clean formatting
   cat [transcript.json3] | jq -r '.events[] | select(.tStartMs != null and .segs != null) | 
   (([.segs[]?.utf8 // empty] | join("") | gsub("\\n"; "")) as $text |
    if ($text | length) > 0 then
      ((.tStartMs / 1000) as $seconds | 
       ($seconds / 60 | floor) as $minutes | 
       ($seconds % 60 | floor) as $secs |
       "[" + ($minutes | tostring) + ":" + (if $secs < 10 then "0" else "" end) + ($secs | tostring) + "] " + $text)
    else empty end)'
   ```

3. **Output Format**:
   - Clean timestamps in [MM:SS] format
   - Removes empty segments and duplicates
   - Ready for integration into project documentation

4. **Workflow Integration**:
   - Use for video content analysis and documentation
   - Store transcripts in project-specific directories
   - Reference in implementation-details for video editing tasks

The system supports rapid task execution while maintaining documentation quality and balancing immediate needs with long-term project knowledge.

## 4. Tiered Knowledge Structure

Knowledge is organized in four tiers with task-oriented loading priorities:

1. **Bootstrap Tier (Minimal Required Knowledge)**
   - `bootstrap.md` - Core system structure
   - `tasks.md` - Registry of all tasks
   - Access only when needed to understand command system or task structure

2. **Critical Tier (Task-Relevant Only)**
   - `activeContext.md` - Current state relevant to immediate task
   - `progress.md` - Status information needed for current step
   - `session_cache.md` - Task contexts for active and paused tasks
   - `errorLog.md` - Record of errors (load when debugging)
   - `edit_history.md` - File modifications (load when context about recent changes needed)
   - Load only files directly relevant to current task step

3. **Essential Tier (Load Only When Required)**
   - `projectbrief.md` - Reference only when task scope is unclear
   - `.cursorrules` - Reference only when implementation patterns are needed
   - Load only when task requirements aren't clear from Critical tier

4. **Reference Tier (Avoid Unless Specifically Needed)**
   - `productContext.md` - Why and how the project works
   - `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
   - `techContext.md` - Technical implementation details
   - Load only specific files when directly relevant to current task step


## 5. Documentation Decision Framework

### 5.1 Update Categories and Sequence

1. **Core Transaction Files** (Every Session, at the end of the session, only after user approval)
   - tasks/[ID].md → tasks.md → session_cache.md
   - sessions/[DATE].md → edit_history.md
2. **Context Files** (When Changed, at the end of the session, only after user approval)
   - activeContext.md (focus/approach changes)
   - errorLog.md (error encounters)
   - progress.md (milestone completion)
   - changelog.md (feature/bug changes)
3. **Architecture Files** (Design Changes Only. When prompted by user or when significant changes occur)
   - systemPatterns.md (patterns)
   - techContext.md (implementation)
   - projectbrief.md (scope)

### 5.2 Change Requirements

| Change Type | Required Updates | Optional Updates |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Task status | task file, tasks.md, session_cache.md | activeContext.md |
| Task creation | tasks.md, new task file, session_cache.md | - |
| Error fixes | errorLog.md, edit_history.md | changelog.md |
| Features | changelog.md, edit_history.md, task files | projectbrief.md |
| Architecture | systemPatterns.md, edit_history.md | techContext.md |
| Multiple edits | edit_history.md, session_cache.md | - |

### 5.3 Maintenance Rules
- Rotate edit_history.md, errorLog.md at 500 lines
- Archive completed tasks after 30 days
- Maintain cross-references when archiving
- See Critical Compliance Requirements section for approval requirements
- Edit history entries must use specified format with file-specific technical changes only
- Edit history entries must not include evaluative or summary content

## 6. Integrated Command System

### 6.1 Task Management Commands

**IMPORTANT: See Critical Compliance Requirements section for approval requirements**

## 7. Integrated Workflows

### 7.1 Task-First Implementation Flow

1. Receive task → analyze minimal requirements → request approval to create/load task
2. After approval, create/load task and analyze immediate needs
3. Request approval to load minimal required context → load context
4. Present implementation plan → request approval → execute
5. Request approval to update edit_history.md with task ID → update
6. For additional steps: repeat context loading, approval, execution, documentation cycle
7. Request approval to complete session → CREATE SESSION FILE FIRST using Section 9.6 template → update session cache using Section 2.10 protocol → update edit_history.md → complete

**See Critical Compliance Requirements section for approval requirements**

### 7.2 Error Handling Flow

1. Identify error cause → request approval before implementing fix → after approval test
2. If fixed: request approval to document in errorLog.md with task ID, then request approval to update edit_history.md
3. If not fixed: return to identification step

**See Critical Compliance Requirements section for approval requirements**

## 8. Technical Implementation Standards

### 8.1 XML Tag Format

Tool use is formatted using XML-style tags:

```
<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</tool_name>
```

### 8.2.0 Path Resolution

1. **Absolute Paths**:
   - Must be relative to `${PROJECT_ROOT}`
   - Example: `src/main.js` refers to `${PROJECT_ROOT}/src/main.js`

2. **Memory Bank Paths**:
   - Must be relative to `${PROJECT_ROOT}/memory-bank`
   - Example: `tasks/T123.md` refers to `${PROJECT_ROOT}/memory-bank/tasks/T123.md`

3. **Path Resolution Rules**:
   - Project files: Always relative to `${PROJECT_ROOT}`
   - Memory bank files: Always relative to `${PROJECT_ROOT}/memory-bank`
   - Never use absolute filesystem paths in documentation

### 8.2 File Operations

**IMPORTANT: See Critical Compliance Requirements section for approval requirements**

**Note:** File editing and creation operations should be performed using the Desktop Commander (dc) MCP server. When editing files, prioritize using block edits (`edit_block` tool) to minimize token usage and ensure precise changes.

#### Reading Files

```
<read_file>
<path>src/main.js</path>
</read_file>
```

With line specifications:

```
<read_file>
<path>src/app.ts</path>
<start_line>46</start_line>
<end_line>68</end_line>
</read_file>
```

#### Searching Files

```
<search_files>
<path>.</path>
<regex>your-pattern-here</regex>
<file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>
</search_files>
```

#### Directory Listing

```
<list_files>
<path>.</path>
<recursive>false</recursive>
</list_files>
```

#### File Modification (Block Edit Format)

For precise, surgical modifications:

```
<edit_block>
<blockContent>File path here
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Original content to find
=======
New content to replace with
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</blockContent>
</edit_block>
```
