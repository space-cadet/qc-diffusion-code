## Focus Task

T5b: Random Walk UI Implementation - Component Refactoring
**Status**: 🔄 REFACTORING
**Time Spent**: 1.5 hours

## Tasks Worked On

### T5b: Random Walk UI Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Completed component extraction from 450-line RandomWalkSim.tsx to organized structure
- Extracted ParticleCanvas component and integrated with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Created RandomWalkSimulator class in separate physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts file
- Extracted SimulationState interface to types/simulation.ts for reusability
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and interface mismatches
- Resolved import issues with ParticleCanvas, ParameterPanel, and DensityComparison components
  **Status Change**: ✅ COMPLETED → 🔄 DEBUGGING

**Additional Work (Late Evening)**:

- Identified animation toggle issue: particles reinitialize instead of freezing positions
- Added targeted console logging to trace particle initialization patterns
- Applied partial fix with memoization for particle options and callback stability
- Root cause: showAnimation toggle causes complete tsParticles container remounting
- Attempted fixes with useMemo and useCallback but issue persists

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - Replaced inline components with imports, reduced from 450+ to ~360 lines
- `frontend/src/physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts` - Extracted class with proper typing and physics integration
- `frontend/src/types/simulation.ts` - Created for SimulationState interface
- `frontend/src/components/ParticleCanvas.tsx` - Updated interface to accept RandomWalkSimulator type
- `frontend/src/components/ParameterPanel.tsx` - Updated simulator ref type to RandomWalkSimulator
- `frontend/src/components/DensityComparison.tsx` - Updated interface for RandomWalkSimulator compatibility
- `frontend/src/hooks/useParticlesEngine.ts` - Fixed import paths and type annotations

## Key Decisions Made

- Prioritized component extraction over performance optimization to improve code maintainability
- Maintained existing functionality while reorganizing code structure for better scalability
- Identified critical performance issue: ts-particles reinitializes on every parameter change instead of only on particle count/reset changes

## Current Issues

- **Performance Problem**: ts-particles system reinitializes whenever any parameter changes (collision rate, jump length, velocity)
- **Animation Toggle Bug**: showAnimation toggle causes particles to reset positions instead of freezing in place
- Applied partial fixes: memoized particle options, stabilized callback references
- Root issue: tsParticles container remounting due to prop changes beyond just particle count
- Console logs confirm particlesLoaded callback triggers on every animation toggle

## Context for Next Session

The component extraction phase is complete and all TypeScript errors are resolved. The main issue now is the ts-particles reinitialization problem which needs investigation. The particle system should only reinitialize when:

1. Particle count changes
2. Reset button is pressed
3. Animation toggle changes

All other parameter changes should only update the physics simulation without reinitializing the visual particle system.

## Next Session Priorities

1. Complete fix for animation toggle particle preservation (high priority)
2. Investigate deeper tsParticles integration to prevent all unnecessary reinitializations
3. Test parameter changes to ensure smooth visual experience without particle resets
4. Continue with remaining component extractions if time permits
5. Add performance monitoring for particle system state changes
