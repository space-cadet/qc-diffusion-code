# Session Notes - 2025-09-10

## Overview
This session focused on updating the memory bank to reflect recent changes, particularly those related to the testing framework and GPU collision system implementation completion.

## Key Activities
*   Identified and summarized staged changes related to frontend dependencies, Vitest configuration, and physics engine test refinements.
*   Created a new task, C23: "Comprehensive Testing Framework Enhancement," to track improvements in the testing infrastructure.
*   Updated the `tasks.md` file to include C23 and reflect the latest timestamp.
*   Documented the testing framework enhancements in `memory-bank/implementation-details/testing-plan.md`.
*   **GPU Collision System Review**: Examined git diff showing major GPU collision implementation completion
*   **Memory Bank Updates**: Updated C16 task file, master tasks, gpu-io-implementation-plan.md with Phase 2 completion
*   Updated session cache and edit history.

## GPU Collision System Implementation (Phase 2 Complete)
**Major Changes Identified**:
- **New GPU Shaders**: `collision.glsl` and `spatialGrid.glsl` for O(n) collision detection
- **Enhanced GPUCollisionManager**: Collision counting, time-based detection (20ms window), parameter updates
- **GPUParticleManager Updates**: Extended collision flash to 500ms, collision tracking, improved parameter flow
- **TextObservableParser Simplification**: Streamlined parsing logic, removed complex comma-splitting
- **UI Enhancements**: Collision visualization and counting in RandomWalkParameterPanel

**Technical Achievements**:
- Spatial grid-based collision detection replacing O(nÂ²) brute force with O(n) performance
- 3x3 neighbor cell checking in collision shader
- Elastic collision physics with proper separation handling for overlapping particles
- Time-based collision tracking with accurate counting and visualization
- Enhanced parameter propagation system for radius and bounds

## Relevant Tasks
*   C15a: Random Walk Physics Engine Implementation Verification
*   C16: GPU.IO Framework Implementation - **Phase 2 Complete** (collision physics)
*   C21: Build and Dependency Vulnerability Resolution
*   C22: Strategy System Implementation and Architecture
*   C23: Comprehensive Testing Framework Enhancement (New)

## Next Steps
*   Generate a commit message for the GPU collision system implementation changes.
