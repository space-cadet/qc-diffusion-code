# Session: 2025-09-09 Morning - Build and Dependency Fixes

**Time**: 2025-09-09 10:51 - 11:08 IST
**Focus**: Resolving critical build errors and dependency vulnerabilities.

## Summary of Work

This session focused on identifying and fixing a series of cascading build errors and security vulnerabilities in the `frontend` and `packages/graph-core` workspaces.

### 1. Dependency Audit and Vulnerability Fixes
- **Initial State**: `npm audit` reported 23 critical vulnerabilities, including malware in `ansi-regex`, `ansi-styles`, and `color-name`.
- **Action**:
    - Ran `npm audit fix` and `npm audit fix --force` to resolve vulnerabilities in both `frontend` and `packages/graph-core`.
- **Result**: All dependency vulnerabilities were successfully patched. `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities.

### 2. Build Error Resolution
A series of TypeScript and configuration errors were preventing the project from building successfully. The following fixes were implemented:

- **Vitest Type Definitions**: Added `"types": ["vitest/globals"]` to `frontend/tsconfig.app.json` to resolve errors where test runners (`describe`, `it`, `expect`) were not found.
- **Duplicate Identifier Fix**: Removed a duplicate import of `PhysicsStrategy` in `frontend/src/physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts`.
- **Type Mismatch Fixes**:
    - Replaced the deprecated `RandomWalkStrategy` with the unified `PhysicsStrategy` interface where it was still being used.
    - Correctly constructed and passed the `PhysicsContext` object in `frontend/src/physics/ParticleManager.ts` to fix argument type errors.
- **Test File Corrections**:
    - Replaced `jest` mock functions with `vi` from Vitest in `frontend/src/webgl/__tests__/boundaryConditions.test.ts`.
    - Fixed a "used before declaration" error in `frontend/src/physics/__tests__/integration.test.ts` by refactoring the `config` object initialization.
    - Added a missing closing brace to fix a syntax error in the same test file.

## Outcome
The project build is now successful. All dependency vulnerabilities and TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved.
