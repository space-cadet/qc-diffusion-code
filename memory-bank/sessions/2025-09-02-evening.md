## Focus Task
T7a: Modular Transparent Observable System Redesign - Floating Panel Architecture Implementation
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: ~2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T7a: Modular Transparent Observable System Redesign
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Created FloatingPanel.tsx component abstracting react-rnd container logic (92 lines)
- Created CustomObservablesPanel.tsx with dedicated custom observables interface (147 lines)
- Extended appStore with customObservablesWindow state and updateCustomObservable method
- Refactored RandomWalkSim.tsx to use FloatingPanel wrapper for both observable panels
- Removed custom observables section from ObservablesPanel.tsx (262→180 lines)
**Status Change**: ✅ COMPLETED (Full Implementation)

### T5b: Random Walk UI Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Extended with floating panel architecture support
- Abstract container logic enables multiple independent floating panels
- Enhanced UI with reusable FloatingPanel component for future panels
**Status Change**: ✅ COMPLETED (Extended with Floating Architecture)

## Files Modified
### FloatingPanel Architecture (T7a + T5b)
- `frontend/src/components/common/FloatingPanel.tsx` - NEW: Reusable floating panel container with drag/resize/collapse (92 lines)
- `frontend/src/components/CustomObservablesPanel.tsx` - NEW: Dedicated custom observables panel with edit/view capabilities (147 lines)
- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - MODIFIED: Added customObservablesWindow state, updateCustomObservable method (+30 lines)
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - MODIFIED: Replaced Rnd wrapper with FloatingPanel, added CustomObservablesPanel (-40 lines net)
- `frontend/src/components/ObservablesPanel.tsx` - MODIFIED: Removed custom observables section (262→180 lines)

## Key Decisions Made
### Floating Panel Architecture
- Used react-rnd as base for all floating behavior (drag, resize, z-index management)
- Created generic FloatingPanel component accepting title, position, size, and event handlers
- Positioned custom observables panel at (460,24) to avoid overlap with built-in panel
- Implemented proper window focus management with click-to-front behavior

### Custom Observable Features
- Added view/edit/remove capabilities for all saved observables
- Implemented inline editing mode with text area, validation, and save/cancel
- Enhanced default template with improved syntax and proper formatting
- Added help text with format guidance and available function reference

### State Management
- Extended appStore with separate window states for each floating panel
- Added updateCustomObservable method for editing existing observables
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing observable system

## Context for Next Session
Floating panel architecture and custom observable system now complete. Two independent floating panels:
1. "Observables" panel (built-in observables like Particle Count, Kinetic Energy, Momentum, MSD)
2. "Custom Observables" panel (user-defined observables with edit/view functionality)

System is ready for:
- Adding new custom observables (e.g., KE fluctuations using std reduce function)
- Future floating panels using FloatingPanel component
- Time-series visualization integration with Analysis page

## Next Session Priorities
1. Test custom observable creation with KE fluctuations example
2. Connect observable system to Analysis page for time-series visualization
3. Implement time-series data collection infrastructure if needed
4. Consider Phase 1 query system development for advanced observable definitions
