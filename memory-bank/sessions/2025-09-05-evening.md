## Focus Task
C12: Interparticle Collisions and Obstacles Implementation
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 1.5 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### C12: Interparticle Collisions and Obstacles Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Renamed `InterparticleCollisionStrategy.ts` to `InterparticleCollisionStrategy2D.ts` for consistency with 1D version
- Implemented `SpatialGrid` utility class (39 lines) for O(n) collision detection replacing O(nÂ²) all-pairs checking
- Added particle ID caching to eliminate repeated string-to-number conversions in collision loops
- Optimized distance calculations using squared distances vs expensive sqrt operations
- Eliminated object creation in collision detection hot path
- Added minimal console logging for performance monitoring and collision event tracking
**Status Change**: IN PROGRESS â†’ IN PROGRESS (optimized for pre-GPU migration)

### C16: GPU.IO Framework Implementation  
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Updated Phase 0 completion status with CPU optimization baseline
- Documented pre-GPU migration performance improvements from C12 optimizations
- Established monitoring framework for GPU vs CPU performance comparison

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/physics/strategies/InterparticleCollisionStrategy.ts` â†’ `InterparticleCollisionStrategy2D.ts` - Renamed and optimized collision detection
- `frontend/src/physics/utils/SpatialGrid.ts` - New spatial partitioning utility for collision optimization
- `frontend/src/physics/factories/StrategyFactory.ts` - Updated import references for renamed strategy
- `memory-bank/tasks/C12.md` - Added optimization progress log entry
- `memory-bank/tasks/C16.md` - Updated Phase 0 completion status
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated C12 and C16 status summaries

## Key Decisions Made
- Prioritized CPU optimization before GPU migration to establish performance baseline
- Implemented spatial grid with fixed 20-unit cell size (future: velocity-dependent cell sizing)
- Added performance monitoring logs to measure optimization effectiveness
- Maintained existing collision physics accuracy while improving performance

### C16: GPU.IO Framework Implementation Phase 1 Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Time Spent**: 1 hour additional
**Progress Made**:
- Created `GPUParticleManager.ts` (80 lines) with GPUComposer, position/velocity layers, and GLSL position update shader
- Integrated GPU physics step into `useParticlesLoader` animation loop with GPU/CPU toggle
- Added `useGPU` state to Zustand store with persistence
- Added purple GPU/CPU toggle button to RandomWalkSim header UI
- Implemented `syncToTsParticles` method for GPU-CPU data synchronization
- Added console logging with [GPU] prefix for debugging GPU operations
**Status Change**: Phase 0 â†’ Phase 1 COMPLETED

## Additional Files Modified (Evening Extended Session)
- `frontend/src/gpu/GPUParticleManager.ts` - New GPU physics manager with position shader
- `frontend/src/hooks/useParticlesLoader.ts` - GPU/CPU physics toggle integration
- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added useGPU state and persistence
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - Added GPU/CPU toggle button
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/gpu-io-implementation-plan.md` - Updated Phase 1 completion status

## Context for Next Session
CPU collision optimizations completed and GPU.IO Phase 1 infrastructure setup completed. GPU position update shader integrated with animation loop. Ready for Phase 2: GPU collision detection shader implementation. Current GPU console logging not appearing - needs debugging in next session.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Debug GPU console logging visibility issue
2. Implement GPU collision detection fragment shader for Phase 2
3. Test GPU position updates with larger particle counts for performance validation
4. Add spatial partitioning optimization to GPU collision detection
