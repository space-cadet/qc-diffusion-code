## Focus Task
C12: Interparticle Collisions and Obstacles Implementation
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 1.5 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### C12: Interparticle Collisions and Obstacles Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Renamed `InterparticleCollisionStrategy.ts` to `InterparticleCollisionStrategy2D.ts` for consistency with 1D version
- Implemented `SpatialGrid` utility class (39 lines) for O(n) collision detection replacing O(nÂ²) all-pairs checking
- Added particle ID caching to eliminate repeated string-to-number conversions in collision loops
- Optimized distance calculations using squared distances vs expensive sqrt operations
- Eliminated object creation in collision detection hot path
- Added minimal console logging for performance monitoring and collision event tracking
**Status Change**: IN PROGRESS â†’ IN PROGRESS (optimized for pre-GPU migration)

### C16: GPU.IO Framework Implementation  
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Updated Phase 0 completion status with CPU optimization baseline
- Documented pre-GPU migration performance improvements from C12 optimizations
- Established monitoring framework for GPU vs CPU performance comparison

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/physics/strategies/InterparticleCollisionStrategy.ts` â†’ `InterparticleCollisionStrategy2D.ts` - Renamed and optimized collision detection
- `frontend/src/physics/utils/SpatialGrid.ts` - New spatial partitioning utility for collision optimization
- `frontend/src/physics/factories/StrategyFactory.ts` - Updated import references for renamed strategy
- `memory-bank/tasks/C12.md` - Added optimization progress log entry
- `memory-bank/tasks/C16.md` - Updated Phase 0 completion status
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated C12 and C16 status summaries

## Key Decisions Made
- Prioritized CPU optimization before GPU migration to establish performance baseline
- Implemented spatial grid with fixed 20-unit cell size (future: velocity-dependent cell sizing)
- Added performance monitoring logs to measure optimization effectiveness
- Maintained existing collision physics accuracy while improving performance

## Context for Next Session
CPU collision detection optimizations completed as preparation for GPU.IO migration. Spatial partitioning should provide 3-5x performance improvement for 1000+ particles. Ready to begin GPU.IO package integration phase of C16.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Begin GPU.IO package integration and rendering engine abstraction design
2. Test optimized CPU collision detection performance with larger particle counts
3. Establish GPU capability detection utilities for cross-platform compatibility
