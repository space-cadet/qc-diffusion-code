## Focus Task
C13: 1D Random Walk Implementation - Density Visualization Fixes
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Time Spent**: 2.5 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### C13: 1D Random Walk Implementation - Session 2
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- **Fixed density visualization issues**: Jagged line chart replaced with smooth area-filled histogram
- **Implemented histogram style**: Professional bars with gradient fills and particle-dependent scaling  
- **Fixed dimension switching**: Canvas now properly constrains particles to horizontal line in 1D mode
- **Corrected adaptive binning**: Fixed scaling factor (0.5→1.5) and removed hardcoded parameters
- **Enhanced density comparison**: Added dimension change triggers for proper canvas redraws
- **Resolved infinite re-render**: Used useCallback to prevent dependency array changes
- **Improved visual clarity**: Added spacing, borders, and smooth scaling for histogram bars

**Technical Achievements**:
- Particle-count-dependent bin scaling: √(particles) × 1.5 formula for 15-60 bin range
- Histogram implementation with gradient fills and professional styling
- Fixed coordinate system alignment for 1D particle constraints
- Optimized React hooks with proper useCallback dependencies

**Issues Identified and Fixed**:
- 1D density profile visualization was unprofessional jagged line
- Canvas display didn't switch between 1D/2D modes properly  
- Adaptive binning was overridden by hardcoded parameters
- Infinite re-render warning from unstable useEffect dependencies

**Outstanding Issues** (deferred):
- Grid distribution not fully captured by histogram resolution
- Some particle counts still don't match expected bin counts

**Status Change**: Bug identification → Visual improvements completed

### META-1: Memory Bank Maintenance and Updates
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Updated C13 task documentation with Session 2 details
- Enhanced master task registry with latest completion status
- Prepared comprehensive memory bank updates with current timestamp
- Updated session documentation with technical achievements

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/hooks/useDensityVisualization.ts` - Histogram implementation and useCallback optimization
- `frontend/src/components/ParticleCanvas.tsx` - Dimension-aware particle positioning  
- `frontend/src/components/DensityComparison.tsx` - Dimension change handling and re-render fix
- `frontend/src/physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts` - Enhanced adaptive binning and dimension switching
- `memory-bank/tasks/C13.md` - Added Session 2 post-implementation updates
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated completion timestamps and file references
- `memory-bank/sessions/2025-08-27-afternoon.md` - Session progress documentation

## Key Decisions Made
- Prioritized visual quality improvements over complete grid distribution fixes
- Used histogram style instead of line charts for better statistical representation
- Implemented smooth particle-count scaling to maintain statistical meaning
- Deferred complex grid resolution issues for future enhancement

## Context for Next Session
C13 density visualization improvements completed. Professional histogram implementation with particle-dependent scaling functional. Grid distribution capturing and remaining binning issues identified for future work.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Address remaining adaptive binning issues for grid distributions
2. Continue with C2a/C2b boundary condition enhancements
3. Begin Matter.js integration for C12 interparticle collisions
