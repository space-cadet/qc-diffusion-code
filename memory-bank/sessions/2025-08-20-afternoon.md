## Focus Task
C3: GPU AMR Integration for PDE Solver
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### C3: GPU AMR Integration for PDE Solver
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Research of existing GPU-AMR implementations (GAMER-2, AGAL, ADAM library)
- Analysis of gaming industry multi-scale rendering solutions (LOD, tessellation, displacement mapping)
- Investigation of hardware tessellation pipeline for adaptive subdivision
- Evaluation of screen-space adaptive LOD and stochastic transitions
- Design of tessellation-based approach for fragment shader conversion
**Status Change**: CREATED â†’ IN PROGRESS

## Files Modified
- `memory-bank/tasks/C3.md` - Created detailed task file with gaming industry approach
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated C3 title and description to reflect tessellation approach
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Added C3 as focus task and updated task registry
- `memory-bank/gpu-amr-integration.md` - Created comprehensive analysis of gaming industry solutions

## Key Decisions Made
- Selected hardware tessellation + displacement mapping approach over custom GPU-AMR
- Identified screen-space adaptive LOD as optimal for performance scaling
- Chose tessellation control/evaluation shader pipeline over compute shader conversion
- Decided on three-phase implementation: tessellation conversion, adaptive criteria, multi-resolution integration

## Context for Next Session
Gaming industry has already solved multi-scale GPU rendering through proven techniques:
- Hardware tessellation units provide dedicated adaptive subdivision
- Screen-space coverage determines tessellation levels automatically
- Displacement mapping adds geometric detail without vertex overhead
- Stochastic LOD transitions eliminate visual artifacts
Next steps: Begin tessellation shader implementation starting with control shader for adaptive subdivision

## Next Session Priorities
1. Convert current fragment shader to tessellation control shader
2. Implement adaptive tessellation criteria based on screen-space derivatives
3. Design tessellation evaluation shader for PDE computation
