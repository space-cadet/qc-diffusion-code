## Focus Task
META-1: Memory Bank Maintenance and GitHub Release
**Status**: ðŸ”„ ACTIVE
**Time Spent**: ~30 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### META-1: Memory Bank Maintenance and Updates
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Updated all core memory bank files to reflect current project state (activeContext, progress, projectbrief, systemPatterns, techContext, changelog, errorLog)
- Created comprehensive README.md with table of contents and project documentation
- Established recurring maintenance task for ongoing documentation consistency

### C10: GitHub App Release v1.0.0
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Updated version numbers to 1.0.0 in both root and frontend package.json files
- Created detailed git commit message with comprehensive feature list
- Created and pushed v1.0.0 git tag with release notes
- Prepared release documentation for GitHub release page
**Status Change**: â¬œ PLANNED â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Updated current focus and project state
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Added comprehensive milestone tracking and achievements
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Enhanced with research contributions and technical innovations
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Added advanced architectural patterns and design details
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Updated with sophisticated technical implementation details
- `memory-bank/changelog.md` - Added complete feature development history
- `memory-bank/errorLog.md` - Added historical error tracking and resolutions
- `README.md` - Created comprehensive project documentation
- `package.json` - Updated to version 1.0.0
- `frontend/package.json` - Updated to version 1.0.0
- `memory-bank/tasks/META-1.md` - Created recurring maintenance task
- `memory-bank/tasks/C10.md` - Created GitHub release task
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added new tasks and updated registry
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Updated current session state

## Key Decisions Made
- Established recurring META-1 task for ongoing memory bank maintenance
- Set version 1.0.0 as first official release representing production-ready system
- Created comprehensive documentation strategy with README and memory bank updates
- Implemented proper git tagging and release preparation workflow

## Context for Next Session
Memory bank system fully updated to reflect current sophisticated project state. GitHub release v1.0.0 prepared and ready for publication. All documentation now accurately represents the advanced physics simulation system with CTRW implementations, WebGL acceleration, and production deployment.

### C5b: Random Walk UI Implementation (Continued)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Enhanced persistent settings: Made observable panel expand/collapse state and all checkbox states (particle count, kinetic energy, momentum components) persistent across page reloads
- Fixed density profile auto-update toggle persistence (record history kept session-specific)
- Corrected observable panel collapsible behavior - panel now properly collapses to header-only instead of maintaining full height
- Added vertical scrolling to observables panel content area
- Identified and resolved performance issue: ParticleCanvas was re-rendering at 60fps due to updateSimulationMetrics calls in animation loop
- Applied performance optimizations: React.memo() on ParticleCanvas, memoized simulationState object, moved time/collision tracking to refs
- Decoupled animation loop from React state updates: removed frame-by-frame metrics updates, added 1-second periodic sync, only update on pause/resume/reset
**Status Change**: âœ… COMPLETED (enhanced)

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added persistent observable and density settings to RandomWalkUIState interface
- `frontend/src/components/ObservablesPanel.tsx` - Connected to Zustand store for persistent state, added kinetic energy and momentum observable controls
- `frontend/src/components/DensityComparison.tsx` - Made auto-update toggle persistent via store
- `frontend/src/components/ParticleCanvas.tsx` - Wrapped with React.memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - Memoized simulationState, moved time/collision tracking to refs, optimized animation loop for performance
- `memory-bank/tasks/C5b.md` - Updated with performance optimization session details

## Key Decisions Made
- Performance over feature completeness: Prioritized 60fps stable rendering over real-time metrics display
- Selective persistence: Made UI state persistent while keeping some settings (record history) session-specific for logical UX
- Animation decoupling: Separated physics simulation from React re-render cycle for optimal performance

## Context for Next Session
C5b performance optimizations complete. Observable registration timing issue identified but not resolved - ParticleCountObservable sometimes shows "No observer registered" due to React.memo affecting useEffect timing. System now maintains stable 60fps animation without excessive React re-renders.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Fix observable registration/unregistration timing issue in ObservablesPanel
2. Continue development on active physics tasks (C7 Observer pattern, C3 GPU AMR)  
3. Test complete persistence workflow and performance under various simulation conditions
4. Maintain memory bank system with regular updates as needed
