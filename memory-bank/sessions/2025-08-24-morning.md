## Focus Task
META-1: Memory Bank Maintenance and GitHub Release
**Status**: ðŸ”„ ACTIVE
**Time Spent**: ~30 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### META-1: Memory Bank Maintenance and Updates
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Updated all core memory bank files to reflect current project state (activeContext, progress, projectbrief, systemPatterns, techContext, changelog, errorLog)
- Created comprehensive README.md with table of contents and project documentation
- Established recurring maintenance task for ongoing documentation consistency

### C10: GitHub App Release v1.0.0
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Updated version numbers to 1.0.0 in both root and frontend package.json files
- Created detailed git commit message with comprehensive feature list
- Created and pushed v1.0.0 git tag with release notes
- Prepared release documentation for GitHub release page
**Status Change**: â¬œ PLANNED â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Updated current focus and project state
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Added comprehensive milestone tracking and achievements
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Enhanced with research contributions and technical innovations
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Added advanced architectural patterns and design details
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Updated with sophisticated technical implementation details
- `memory-bank/changelog.md` - Added complete feature development history
- `memory-bank/errorLog.md` - Added historical error tracking and resolutions
- `README.md` - Created comprehensive project documentation
- `package.json` - Updated to version 1.0.0
- `frontend/package.json` - Updated to version 1.0.0
- `memory-bank/tasks/META-1.md` - Created recurring maintenance task
- `memory-bank/tasks/C10.md` - Created GitHub release task
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added new tasks and updated registry
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Updated current session state

## Key Decisions Made
- Established recurring META-1 task for ongoing memory bank maintenance
- Set version 1.0.0 as first official release representing production-ready system
- Created comprehensive documentation strategy with README and memory bank updates
- Implemented proper git tagging and release preparation workflow

## Context for Next Session
Memory bank system fully updated to reflect current sophisticated project state. GitHub release v1.0.0 prepared and ready for publication. All documentation now accurately represents the advanced physics simulation system with CTRW implementations, WebGL acceleration, and production deployment.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Continue development on active physics tasks (C7 Observer pattern, C3 GPU AMR)
2. Monitor GitHub release publication and user feedback
3. Maintain memory bank system with regular updates as needed
