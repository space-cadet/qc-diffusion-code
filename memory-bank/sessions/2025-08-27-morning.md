## Focus Task
C2a/C2b: Boundary Conditions Safe Component Import
**Status**: C2b âœ… COMPLETED, C2a ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS  
**Time Spent**: 45 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### C12: Interparticle Collisions and Obstacles Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Created comprehensive implementation plan document in `memory-bank/implementation-details/interparticle-collision-plan.md`
- Analyzed DynamicalBilliards.jl collision detection approaches vs current system
- Researched Matter.js and Rapier.js built-in obstacle support capabilities
- Documented hybrid physics architecture with ASCII visualization
- Identified Matter.js as recommended starting point, Rapier.js for performance upgrade
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

### C2a: PDE Solver Methods and Boundary Conditions
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Progress Made**:
- Safely imported BC components from boundary-conditions branch (d1e4c)
- Created abstract BaseBoundaryCondition interface with clean API
- Added BoundaryConditionType type definition to types.ts
- Implemented placeholder DirichletBC and NeumannBC classes without problematic shader integration
- Added comprehensive boundary conditions test infrastructure
**Status Change**: Shader compilation issues â†’ Safe infrastructure ready

### C2b: PDE UI Implementation
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Added complete boundary conditions UI section to PdeParameterPanel.tsx
- Implemented dropdown selection for Neumann vs Dirichlet boundary conditions
- Added conditional Dirichlet value input field
- Enhanced PlotComponent.tsx with BC annotations showing current type and values
- Updated import statements for BoundaryConditionType
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/interparticle-collision-plan.md` - Created comprehensive implementation plan with architecture diagrams and obstacle strategies
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added C12 task entry with details and dependencies
- `frontend/src/types.ts` - Added BoundaryConditionType union type and boundaryCondition/dirichlet_value parameters
- `frontend/src/webgl/boundary-conditions/BaseBoundaryCondition.ts` - Created abstract BC interface with clean API
- `frontend/src/webgl/boundary-conditions/DirichletBC.ts` - Placeholder DirichletBC implementation without shader issues
- `frontend/src/webgl/boundary-conditions/NeumannBC.ts` - Placeholder NeumannBC implementation without shader issues
- `frontend/src/PdeParameterPanel.tsx` - Added complete boundary conditions UI section with dropdown and conditional inputs
- `frontend/src/PlotComponent.tsx` - Added boundary condition annotations to plot display
- `frontend/src/webgl/__tests__/boundaryConditions.test.ts` - Comprehensive BC test infrastructure

## Key Decisions Made
- Selected Matter.js for Phase 1 implementation due to ease of use and built-in obstacle support
- Identified that both physics engines have excellent obstacle capabilities, eliminating need for custom DynamicalBilliards-style implementation
- Planned hybrid approach combining inter-particle collisions with existing CTRW background scattering
- Imported only safe BC components from boundary-conditions branch to avoid WebGL shader integration issues
- Created clean separation between BC interface and implementation to enable proper BC development later
- Completed full BC UI functionality without backend enforcement dependencies

## Context for Next Session
C2b boundary conditions UI completed successfully - users can now select BC types and set values in the interface. C2a has safe BC infrastructure ready. C12 implementation plan completed and ready for Matter.js integration. Focus areas: proper BC enforcement implementation and particle-particle collision detection.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Implement correct boundary condition enforcement using post-processing or shader-based approach
2. Begin Matter.js integration with existing ParticleManager system for C12
3. Create proper DirichletBC/NeumannBC implementations replacing placeholder versions
