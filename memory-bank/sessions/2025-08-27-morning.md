## Focus Task
C12: Interparticle Collisions and Obstacles Implementation
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 20 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### C12: Interparticle Collisions and Obstacles Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Created comprehensive implementation plan document in `memory-bank/implementation-details/interparticle-collision-plan.md`
- Analyzed DynamicalBilliards.jl collision detection approaches vs current system
- Researched Matter.js and Rapier.js built-in obstacle support capabilities
- Documented hybrid physics architecture with ASCII visualization
- Identified Matter.js as recommended starting point, Rapier.js for performance upgrade
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

## Files Modified
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/interparticle-collision-plan.md` - Created comprehensive implementation plan with architecture diagrams and obstacle strategies
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added C12 task entry with details and dependencies

## Key Decisions Made
- Selected Matter.js for Phase 1 implementation due to ease of use and built-in obstacle support
- Identified that both physics engines have excellent obstacle capabilities, eliminating need for custom DynamicalBilliards-style implementation
- Planned hybrid approach combining inter-particle collisions with existing CTRW background scattering

## Context for Next Session
Implementation plan completed. Ready to begin Phase 1 Matter.js integration with existing CTRWStrategy system. Key focus areas: particle-particle collision detection, obstacle creation tools, and performance optimization.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Begin Matter.js integration with existing ParticleManager system
2. Create MatterCTRWStrategy implementation following planned architecture
3. Add obstacle creation and management interface components
