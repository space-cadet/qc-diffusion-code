## Focus
C15a Random Walk Physics Engine Implementation Verification - dt plumbing and memory leak tracking

## Tasks
- C15a: Random Walk Physics Engine Implementation Verification

## Summary
Completed comprehensive dt parameter propagation and UI control fixes for Random Walk simulation. Session focused on three main areas:

1. **dt Parameter Propagation**: Fixed missing dt parameter flow from UI to RandomWalkSimulator constructor and updateParameters calls, enabling proper timestep control from UI slider.

2. **LogNumberSlider Responsiveness**: Fixed slider movement and log-scale toggle issues by correcting log mapping (removed +1 hacks), eliminating forced rounding for continuous sliders, and adding discrete mode for integer-only outputs.

3. **Container Lifecycle Fix**: Resolved blank particle canvas by fixing useParticlesLoader container destruction, limiting cleanup to requestAnimationFrame cancellation only.

All changes enable proper UI control over physics simulation with visible particle rendering and responsive slider controls.

## Changes Made

### dt Parameter Propagation
1. **RandomWalkSim.tsx**:
   - Added dt: gridLayoutParams.dt to RandomWalkSimulator constructor
   - Added dt: gridLayoutParams.dt to all updateParameters calls (effects and handleInitialize)

### LogNumberSlider Fixes  
2. **LogNumberSlider.tsx**:
   - Fixed log mapping: removed +1 hacks, use proper log10(min..max)
   - Removed forced rounding for continuous sliders
   - Added discrete?: boolean prop for integer-only outputs
   - Enhanced number input with raw numeric values and step support
   - Improved min/max label formatting with precision

3. **RandomWalkParameterPanel.tsx**:
   - Removed logScale={true} from dt slider to allow checkbox toggle
   - Added discrete prop to Particles slider for integer values
   - Kept dt and Temperature sliders continuous

### Container Lifecycle Fix
4. **useParticlesLoader.ts**:
   - Fixed cleanup to only cancel requestAnimationFrame
   - Removed container.destroy() call that was causing blank canvas
   - Limited cleanup scope to preserve container lifecycle

### Memory Bank Updates
5. **Updated task files**: C15.md, C5b.md with session progress
6. **Updated verification plan**: Added Phase 4 UI control fixes completion
7. **Updated UI interface docs**: Added 2025-08-31 control enhancements section

## Next Steps
1. Address collision strategy visibility issues - particles don't show visible collisions despite counter updating
2. Fix 1D/2D canvas dimension switching requiring full page refresh
3. Investigate CTRW scattering visibility - random scatterings not visually apparent
4. Implement remaining verification plan items from Phase 5

## Results
- dt slider now controls physics timestep properly
- Particles visible and moving correctly in simulation
- Slider controls responsive with smooth movement and working log-scale toggle
- Discrete particle count slider provides integer values only
- Container lifecycle preserved across parameter changes

## Issues Resolved
- Fixed blank particle canvas caused by premature container destruction
- Fixed unresponsive dt parameter not reaching physics engine
- Fixed slider not moving due to incorrect log mapping
- Fixed log-scale checkbox not responding due to forced controlled state
