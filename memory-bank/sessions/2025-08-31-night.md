## Focus
C15a Random Walk Physics Engine Implementation Verification - dt plumbing and memory leak tracking

## Tasks
- C15a: Random Walk Physics Engine Implementation Verification

## Summary
Completed dt plumbing through the entire application stack, ensuring UI-controlled timestep parameter is properly propagated through all layers. Added getter/setter methods to ParameterManager for dt and included dt in the physics parameters returned by getPhysicsParameters. This completes Step 2 of the Random Walk simulation improvements, removing all hardcoded timestep values and enabling dynamic timestep control from the UI.

Identified a critical memory leak issue causing the browser tab to consume several gigabytes of memory when simulations are running. This issue has been documented in the verification plan and task files for investigation in the next session.

## Changes Made
1. Updated ParameterManager.ts:
   - Added dt property to SimulatorParams interface
   - Added dt field to ParameterManager class
   - Added dt initialization in constructor with default 0.01
   - Added dt update in updateParameters method
   - Added getTimeStep() and setTimeStep() methods
   - Included dt in getPhysicsParameters() return value
2. Updated RandomWalkSimulator.ts:
   - Replaced hardcoded timeStep: 0.01 with this.parameterManager.dt
   - Enhanced updateConfiguration to handle dt changes without engine rebuild
   - Added dtChanged detection and partial configuration updates
3. Updated RandomWalkSim.tsx:
   - Added key={`canvas-${gridLayoutParams.dimension}`} to ParticleCanvas component to force remount on dimension change
   - Added gridLayoutParams.dimension to useEffect dependency array for canvas initialization
4. Updated useParticlesLoader.ts:
   - Replaced hardcoded physicsTimeStep = 0.01 with store value
   - Added fallback with Math.max(1e-6, gridLayoutParamsRef.current?.dt ?? 0.01)
5. Updated CTRWStrategy1D.ts and CTRWStrategy2D.ts:
   - Replaced simDt(0.01) calls with simDt() to use global time settings
6. Updated appStore.ts:
   - Added dt: 0.01 to initial state
   - Added dt migration for persisted state
7. Updated simulationTypes.ts:
   - Added dt field to RandomWalkParams interface
8. Updated memory bank files:
   - Added memory leak issue to C15a task file and verification plan
   - Updated task status to reflect dt plumbing completion

## Next Steps
1. Perform QA testing to verify dt slider affects physics speed and trajectories correctly
2. Investigate and fix the memory leak causing excessive browser memory usage
3. Implement Step 3: CTRW cleanup (single trajectory update, unified time, boundary pre-commit)
4. Address remaining issues from verification plan Phase 4

## Notes
The memory leak appears to be related to the animation loop or particle tracking system, as memory usage grows continuously while simulations are running. This will be a priority for the next session as it severely impacts application usability for longer simulation runs.
