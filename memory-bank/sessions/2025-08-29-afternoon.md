## Focus Task
C15: Physics Engine Architecture Migration
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 2+ hours

## Tasks Worked On
### C15: Physics Engine Architecture Migration  
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Fixed critical velocity property mismatch (vx/vy vs x/y) in ParticleManager.initializeParticle()
- Cleaned up LegacyBallisticStrategy import aliasing in RandomWalkSimulator.ts
- Corrected step() method logic to properly call particleManager.update(dt)
- Added extensive debug logging infrastructure throughout execution chain
- Temporarily disabled momentum conservation for debugging purposes
**Status Change**: Phase 3.5 â†’ Phase 4 (Issue Resolution & Testing)

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts` - Import fix, strategy initialization, step method correction, momentum conservation debugging
- `frontend/src/physics/ParticleManager.ts` - Critical velocity property fix (vx/vy), debug logging enhancement
- `frontend/src/physics/strategies/LegacyBallisticStrategy.ts` - Comprehensive debug logging with precision tracking

## Key Decisions Made
- Root cause identified: velocity property naming mismatch between thermal generation ({vx,vy}) and initialization reading ({x,y})
- Prioritized functionality restoration over momentum conservation during debugging phase
- Implemented comprehensive debug logging infrastructure for future troubleshooting

## Context for Next Session
Physics simulation is now functional with visible particle movement after resolving the velocity property mismatch. The C15 migration has progressed from architecture scaffolding to working implementation. Full testing and validation of all simulation features remains to be completed.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Comprehensive testing of all physics simulation features (1D/2D, various strategies, boundary conditions)
2. Validation of particle visualization, density calculations, and observable measurements
3. Performance testing and memory leak detection
4. Re-enable momentum conservation once core functionality is validated
5. Consider moving to Phase 5 (boundary centralization) if all features are working properly
