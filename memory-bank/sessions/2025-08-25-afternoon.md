## Focus Task
C2a/C2b: PDE Boundary Conditions and UI Enhancements
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 2 hours 15 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### C11: PDE Solver Choice Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Added animation speed slider with 0.1x-5.0x range control in PlotComponent
- Modified WebGL animation loop to support multiple steps per frame for speedup
- Implemented LaxWendroffSolver class with proper 2-step predictor-corrector method
- Added solver factory integration and type definitions
- Updated UI dropdown with Lax-Wendroff option for telegraph equation
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

### C2a: PDE Solver Methods and Boundary Conditions
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Fixed Lax-Wendroff solver missing CLAMP_TO_EDGE texture wrapping for consistent Neumann boundaries
- Implemented automatic dt stability guard in ForwardEulerSolver with CFL conditions (safety=0.9)
- Combined diffusion (dt â‰¤ 0.5Ã—dxÂ²/k) and telegraph (dt â‰¤ dx/v) stability limits
- Created comprehensive documentation at memory-bank/implementation-details/pde-bcs-equations-stability.md
- Non-invasive implementation preserving UI dt while using effective dt in shader
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

### C2b: PDE UI Implementation  
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Enhanced "Conserved Quantities" panel readability with larger fonts (text-sm/base)
- Added "Time Step Diagnostics" section showing UI dt, effective dt, and stability limits
- Added "Parameters" section displaying selected equations and current values
- Standardized all numerical displays with monospace fonts for consistency
- Improved contrast with better color scheme (gray-600/700/800)
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/types.ts` - Added animationSpeed parameter to SimulationParams
- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added animation speed default value
- `frontend/src/PlotComponent.tsx` - Implemented speed slider control, dt diagnostics computation
- `frontend/src/hooks/useWebGLSolver.ts` - Modified animation timing with multiple steps per frame
- `frontend/src/webgl/solvers/LaxWendroffSolver.ts` - New hyperbolic solver implementation, added CLAMP_TO_EDGE
- `frontend/src/webgl/solvers/ForwardEulerSolver.ts` - Added automatic dt stability guard with CFL conditions
- `frontend/src/ConservationDisplay.tsx` - Enhanced readability, added dt diagnostics and parameters sections
- `frontend/src/PdeParameterPanel.tsx` - Added Lax-Wendroff option to telegraph solver dropdown
- `memory-bank/tasks/C2a.md` - Task file for solver methods and boundary conditions (updated)
- `memory-bank/tasks/C2b.md` - Task file for PDE UI enhancements (updated)
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated task registry with session progress
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Updated current session focus and task statuses
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/pde-bcs-equations-stability.md` - Comprehensive session documentation

## Key Decisions Made
- Used setTimeout with frame delay calculation instead of requestAnimationFrame for speed control
- Implemented multiple simulation steps per frame for speeds >1x rather than just reducing delays
- Created separate tasks C2a/C2b to organize PDE solver work into methods vs UI concerns
- Chose Lax-Wendroff over Crank-Nicolson for telegraph equation due to hyperbolic nature
- Fixed boundary condition inconsistency by adding CLAMP_TO_EDGE to all solvers for unified Neumann BCs
- Implemented non-invasive dt stability guard preserving UI control while ensuring numerical stability
- Enhanced Conservation panel with comprehensive diagnostics and standardized formatting

## Context for Next Session
Boundary condition unification completed - all solvers now use consistent Neumann boundaries via CLAMP_TO_EDGE. Forward Euler stability significantly improved with automatic dt clamping based on CFL conditions. Conservation panel enhanced with dt diagnostics, parameter display, and improved readability. Comprehensive documentation created for session work.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Test unified boundary behavior across solvers (Forward Euler vs Lax-Wendroff reflective consistency)
2. Implement flexible boundary condition system (Dirichlet, Periodic, Absorbing) with shader-based selection
3. Add per-equation solver selection UI integration
4. Consider optional UI feedback for dt capping events and stability warnings
