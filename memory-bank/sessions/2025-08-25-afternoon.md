## Focus Task
C11: PDE Solver Choice Implementation
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 45 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### C11: PDE Solver Choice Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Added animation speed slider with 0.1x-5.0x range control in PlotComponent
- Modified WebGL animation loop to support multiple steps per frame for speedup
- Implemented LaxWendroffSolver class with proper 2-step predictor-corrector method
- Added solver factory integration and type definitions
- Updated UI dropdown with Lax-Wendroff option for telegraph equation
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

### C2a: PDE Solver Methods and Boundary Conditions (NEW)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Created task framework for boundary condition system implementation
- Identified current hardcoded Neumann boundary conditions (CLAMP_TO_EDGE)
- Documented need for flexible BC system (Dirichlet, Periodic, Absorbing)
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ ðŸ†• NEW

### C2b: PDE UI Implementation (NEW)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Created task framework for enhanced PDE parameter controls
- Documented animation speed slider completion
- Identified boundary condition UI requirements
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ ðŸ†• NEW

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/types.ts` - Added animationSpeed parameter to SimulationParams
- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added animation speed default value
- `frontend/src/PlotComponent.tsx` - Implemented speed slider control
- `frontend/src/hooks/useWebGLSolver.ts` - Modified animation timing with multiple steps per frame
- `frontend/src/webgl/solvers/LaxWendroffSolver.ts` - New hyperbolic solver implementation
- `frontend/src/PdeParameterPanel.tsx` - Added Lax-Wendroff option to telegraph solver dropdown
- `memory-bank/tasks/C2a.md` - New task file for solver methods and boundary conditions
- `memory-bank/tasks/C2b.md` - New task file for PDE UI enhancements
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added new tasks to registry

## Key Decisions Made
- Used setTimeout with frame delay calculation instead of requestAnimationFrame for speed control
- Implemented multiple simulation steps per frame for speeds >1x rather than just reducing delays
- Created separate tasks C2a/C2b to organize PDE solver work into methods vs UI concerns
- Chose Lax-Wendroff over Crank-Nicolson for telegraph equation due to hyperbolic nature

## Context for Next Session
Telegraph equation instability resolved with Lax-Wendroff solver. Animation speed control working properly for both slow and fast speeds. Need to implement boundary condition system and enhance UI controls for better physics simulation flexibility.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Implement boundary condition parameter system in SimulationParams
2. Add BC selection UI controls in PdeParameterPanel
3. Modify WebGL texture wrapping based on BC selection
4. Update planning documents for visual-pde integration
