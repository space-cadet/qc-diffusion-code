## Focus Task
C16a: GPU.IO Architecture Refactoring and Modularization
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 30 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### C16a: GPU.IO Architecture Refactoring and Modularization
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Created task C16a to document GPT-5 refactoring work on GPU.IO implementation
- Updated memory bank files to record externalization of inline shaders
- Documented extraction of utility functions into modular lib/ directory structure
- Recorded shader files: positionUpdate.glsl, velocityUpdate.glsl, collision_pairs.glsl, spatialGrid.glsl, collision_detection.glsl
- Documented utility modules: SpatialGrid.ts, ColorUtils.ts, GPUParams.ts, GPUSync.ts
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

## Files Modified
- `memory-bank/tasks/C16a.md` - Created new task file documenting refactoring work
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added C16a to active tasks registry with dependencies
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Updated current session and task registry
- `memory-bank/sessions/2025-09-11-night.md` - Created this session file

## Key Decisions Made
- Created dedicated task C16a for refactoring work to maintain clear separation from main C16 GPU implementation
- Referenced GPU implementation plan refactoring section for context
- Documented all externalized shaders and utility modules for future reference
- Established foundation for subsequent modular architecture development

## Context for Next Session
GPT-5 has completed significant refactoring of GPU.IO implementation:
- All inline GLSL shaders externalized to separate files using `?raw` imports
- Utility functions extracted to logical modules in lib/ directory
- Main GPU manager files reduced in size and complexity
- No runtime behavior changes - pure refactoring for maintainability
- Foundation established for future modular split (GPUState, GPUPrograms, GPUPasses, GPUDebug)

## Next Session Priorities
1. Continue C16a implementation with remaining modular architecture components
2. Review and test that refactored code maintains identical behavior
3. Consider further architectural improvements based on established patterns
