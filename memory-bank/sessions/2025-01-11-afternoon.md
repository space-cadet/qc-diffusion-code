## Focus Task
C24: Quantum Walk Explorer Implementation
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Active Tasks
### C24: Quantum Walk Explorer Implementation
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Progress**:
1. ✅ Implemented comprehensive parameter specification panel with decoherence/ensemble controls
2. ✅ Added classical comparison with overlay/split visualization modes
3. ✅ Expanded observables panel with spread width and regime detection
4. ✅ Applied unified styling to match Random Walk Sim and Analysis pages
5. ✅ Created memory bank documentation following protocol

## Context and Working State
Session focused on memory bank updates for completed QuantumWalkPage.tsx implementation. The quantum walk explorer was fully implemented with all requested features from the ts-quantum demo, including parameter panels, classical comparison, decoherence logic, and unified styling.

## Critical Files
- `frontend/src/QuantumWalkPage.tsx`: Main quantum walk implementation (completed)
- `memory-bank/tasks.md`: Updated with C24 task entry
- `memory-bank/tasks/C24.md`: Created detailed task documentation
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/quantum-walk-implementation.md`: Implementation documentation (to be created)

## Session Notes
- Memory bank update protocol followed for completed quantum walk implementation
- Task C24 added to registry with completed status
- Individual task file created with comprehensive progress tracking
- Implementation details documentation needs to be created
- Edit history and session cache updates pending per protocol
