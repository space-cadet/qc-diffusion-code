### density.ts
- **Lines Modified**: 8-86
- **Changes**:
  - Commented out verbose console.log debug statements
  - Cleaned up logging output in density profile calculation function
  - Improved performance by removing unnecessary debug output

### RandomWalkSimulator.ts
- **Lines Modified**: 262-275
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed typo in method name from evgetObservableData to getObservableData
  - Corrected observable data retrieval method naming

## Technical Implementation Details

### PhysicsStrategy Interface Implementation
- Both collision strategies now implement the PhysicsStrategy interface in addition to RandomWalkStrategy
- This enables them to work with the new physics engine architecture
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing strategy system

### Two-Phase Execution Model
- **preUpdate()**: Handles collision detection and velocity updates
- **integrate()**: Handles position updates and boundary condition application
- Separates concerns for better modularity and testing

### Coordinate System Integration
- Strategies now use coordinate system transformations for position updates
- Boundary conditions applied consistently through coordinate system abstraction
- Unified approach to physics calculations across all strategies

### Trajectory Recording
- Added proper trajectory point recording using simTime() for consistent timestamps
- Ensures trajectory data is synchronized with simulation time management

## Memory Bank Updates
- Updated task files C2a.md and C5b.md with latest implementation details
- Updated master tasks.md registry with current status
- Updated coordinate-system-design.md implementation documentation
- Updated physics-engine-rewrite-migration-plan.md with progress details

## Next Steps
- Complete session cache and edit history updates
- Generate commit message for staged changes
- Continue with physics engine architecture migration

## Session Context
This session focused on implementing the PhysicsStrategy interface in collision strategies as part of the broader physics engine architecture migration. The changes maintain backward compatibility while enabling the new two-phase execution model for improved modularity and boundary condition handling.
