## Focus Task

C5b, C8: Grid Layout Persistence + Distribution Controls System + Coordinate System Fixes
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: ~1.5 hours

## Tasks Worked On

### C5b: Random Walk UI Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- **Claude**: Fixed React Grid Layout panel positions/sizes not persisting between page reloads by adding `randomWalkSimLayouts` state to Zustand store in `appStore.ts`
- **GPT5**: Implemented comprehensive particle distribution controls with 5 distribution types (uniform, gaussian, ring, stripe, grid)
- **GPT5**: Added conditional rendering of distribution controls for continuum mode only in `ParameterPanel.tsx`
- **GPT5**: Extended `SimulatorParams` interface with distribution fields and implemented sophisticated distribution sampling methods
- **Claude 3.5**: Fixed final synchronization issue ensuring initial particle visualization matches selected distribution immediately after initialization
  **Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

### C8: Density Profile Calculation Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- **GPT5**: Fixed density profile clustering at corners by correcting coordinate mapping in `RandomWalkSimulator.ts` initialization
- **GPT5**: Ensured proper coordinate conversion flow: canvas â†’ physics (ParticleManager) â†’ density calculation uses physics coordinates
- **GPT5**: Added proper canvas size tracking and propagation to ParticleManager for correct coordinate transformations
- **GPT5**: Made `mapToCanvas()` method public in `ParticleManager.ts` for visualization synchronization
  **Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added `randomWalkSimLayouts` state and persistence by Claude
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - Integrated persisted layouts from store by Claude
- `frontend/src/components/ParameterPanel.tsx` - Added distribution controls UI with conditional rendering by GPT5
- `frontend/src/physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts` - Extended interface, added distribution sampling, fixed coordinate initialization by GPT5
- `frontend/src/physics/ParticleManager.ts` - Made `mapToCanvas()` public for visualization sync by GPT5

## Key Decisions Made

- **Coordinate System Architecture**: Established clear separation between canvas coordinates (0,canvasWidth) used for UI and physics coordinates (-200,+200) used internally
- **Distribution Sampling**: Implemented sophisticated mathematical samplers including Box-Muller transform for Gaussian, polar coordinates for rings, grid positioning with jitter
- **State Persistence Strategy**: Used existing Zustand store pattern for consistency with rest of application
- **AI Collaboration Approach**: Leveraged each AI's strengths - Claude for state management, GPT5 for mathematical algorithms, Claude 3.5 for synchronization details

## Context for Next Session

All major issues resolved in this session:

1. Grid layout positions now persist across page reloads
2. Complete distribution controls system implemented with 5 distribution types
3. Coordinate system clustering issue fixed with proper physics-canvas mapping
4. Initial particle visualization synchronized with selected distribution patterns
5. Ready for telegraph equation verification with properly functioning density calculations

## Repository Extraction and Deployment Work

### C9: Standalone Repository Setup and Vercel Deployment

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- **Claude**: Used git subtree to extract code directory from main qc-diffusion repository with complete commit history from 72e18 onwards
- **Claude**: Created new GitHub repository at https://github.com/space-cadet/qc-diffusion-code
- **Claude**: Copied graph-core and graph-ui packages from spin-network-app to eliminate external path dependencies
- **Claude**: Updated frontend/package.json to reference local graph-core package at `../packages/graph-core`
- **Claude**: Created vercel.json configuration with proper monorepo setup (moved to frontend directory)
- **Claude**: Fixed Vercel schema validation errors by removing invalid `rootDirectory` property
- **Claude**: Resolved directory structure issues for Vercel build process

**Status Change**: â¬œ PLANNED â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

**Current Issues**:
- pnpm lockfile out of sync after adding local graph-core dependency
- Node version compatibility issues preventing lockfile regeneration
- ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE error blocking Vercel deployment

## Files Modified (Repository Setup)
- `frontend/package.json` - Updated to use local graph-core dependency
- `frontend/vercel.json` - Created and configured for monorepo deployment
- `packages/graph-core/` - Copied from spin-network-app
- `packages/graph-ui/` - Copied from spin-network-app

**CONTINUATION - UI Enhancement Work (2025-08-23 21:00-21:36 IST)**:

### C5b: Random Walk UI Implementation (Continued)

**Priority**: HIGH
**Additional Progress Made**:

- **Claude**: Modernized simulation control buttons with shadcn-inspired styling including proper hover states, focus rings, clean SVG icons instead of emojis
- **Claude**: Repositioned simulation controls (Initialize, Start/Pause, Reset) to top of parameters panel for immediate accessibility without scrolling
- **Claude**: Enhanced status display with colored dots instead of emoji bullets, monospace fonts for time/collision counters, integrated with controls in clean card layout
- **Claude**: Implemented collapsible sections for Random Walk Strategy, Boundary Conditions, Physics Parameters, and Initial Distribution with chevron indicators and smooth animations
- **Claude**: Extended Zustand store to include UI collapsible states (`randomWalkUIState`) and simulation runtime state (`randomWalkSimulationState`) for full persistence
- **Claude**: Enhanced persistence to include particle positions, velocities, collision data, density history, and observable data in Zustand store
- **Claude**: Implemented auto-save system with periodic state saving (every 2 seconds during simulation) and save on pause/stop events
- **Claude**: Added state restoration logic to rebuild simulation from stored data on page reload (implementation completed but restoration not working - needs debugging)

**External TypeScript Fixes Applied**:
- **External**: Fixed `CTRWStrategy.test.ts` - Added missing `waitingTime: 0` to mock particle object
- **External**: Fixed `ParticleManager.ts` - Added `waitingTime: 0` to particle initialization  
- **External**: Fixed `simulation.ts` interface - Updated `SimulationState` with optional persistence properties
- **External**: Fixed `Particle.ts` interface - Added `waitingTime: number` to Particle interface
- **External**: Fixed `RandomWalkUsed.tsx` - Corrected particle addition API syntax and closing tag structure

## Additional Files Modified (UI Enhancement Session)

- `frontend/src/components/ParameterPanel.tsx` - Modern button styling, collapsible sections, repositioned controls
- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Extended with UI state and enhanced simulation persistence
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - State restoration logic, auto-save system, Zustand integration
- `frontend/src/physics/types/Particle.ts` - Added waitingTime property
- `frontend/src/types/simulation.ts` - Extended SimulationState interface
- `frontend/src/physics/ParticleManager.ts` - Added waitingTime initialization
- `frontend/src/physics/__tests__/CTRWStrategy.test.ts` - Fixed mock particle object

## Key Decisions Made (UI Enhancement)

- **Button Design Philosophy**: Adopted shadcn design system approach with proper accessibility, hover states, and semantic color coding (blue/green/amber/red)
- **Control Positioning**: Moved simulation controls to top of parameters panel to eliminate scrolling requirement for primary actions
- **Collapsible Strategy**: Implemented accordion-style sections to manage panel space while maintaining access to all controls
- **State Persistence Architecture**: Extended Zustand store to capture complete simulation state including particle physics data for true cross-reload continuity
- **Auto-Save Frequency**: Chose 2-second intervals to balance performance with data safety during active simulation

## Context for Next Session

**Major Progress**:
1. Complete UI modernization with professional button styling and improved accessibility
2. Full simulation state persistence architecture implemented (though restoration needs debugging)
3. Enhanced user experience with collapsible sections and repositioned controls
4. All TypeScript type errors resolved across entire codebase

**Outstanding Issues**:
1. **CRITICAL**: State restoration on page reload not working despite implementation - requires debugging
2. pnpm lockfile synchronization still needed for Vercel deployment
3. Coordinate system fixes need verification with restored particle states

## Next Session Priorities

1. **URGENT**: Debug state restoration functionality - particles should maintain ring distribution after page reload
2. Verify complete persistence workflow including particle positions, simulation time, collision counts
3. Fix pnpm lockfile synchronization to enable Vercel deployment
4. Test end-to-end user workflow with enhanced UI and persistent state
5. Implement telegraph equation verification with corrected density profile calculations
