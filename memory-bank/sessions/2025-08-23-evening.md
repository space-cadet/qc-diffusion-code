## Focus Task

C5b, C8: Grid Layout Persistence + Distribution Controls System + Coordinate System Fixes
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: ~1.5 hours

## Tasks Worked On

### C5b: Random Walk UI Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- **Claude**: Fixed React Grid Layout panel positions/sizes not persisting between page reloads by adding `randomWalkSimLayouts` state to Zustand store in `appStore.ts`
- **GPT5**: Implemented comprehensive particle distribution controls with 5 distribution types (uniform, gaussian, ring, stripe, grid)
- **GPT5**: Added conditional rendering of distribution controls for continuum mode only in `ParameterPanel.tsx`
- **GPT5**: Extended `SimulatorParams` interface with distribution fields and implemented sophisticated distribution sampling methods
- **Claude 3.5**: Fixed final synchronization issue ensuring initial particle visualization matches selected distribution immediately after initialization
  **Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

### C8: Density Profile Calculation Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- **GPT5**: Fixed density profile clustering at corners by correcting coordinate mapping in `RandomWalkSimulator.ts` initialization
- **GPT5**: Ensured proper coordinate conversion flow: canvas â†’ physics (ParticleManager) â†’ density calculation uses physics coordinates
- **GPT5**: Added proper canvas size tracking and propagation to ParticleManager for correct coordinate transformations
- **GPT5**: Made `mapToCanvas()` method public in `ParticleManager.ts` for visualization synchronization
  **Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added `randomWalkSimLayouts` state and persistence by Claude
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - Integrated persisted layouts from store by Claude
- `frontend/src/components/ParameterPanel.tsx` - Added distribution controls UI with conditional rendering by GPT5
- `frontend/src/physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts` - Extended interface, added distribution sampling, fixed coordinate initialization by GPT5
- `frontend/src/physics/ParticleManager.ts` - Made `mapToCanvas()` public for visualization sync by GPT5

## Key Decisions Made

- **Coordinate System Architecture**: Established clear separation between canvas coordinates (0,canvasWidth) used for UI and physics coordinates (-200,+200) used internally
- **Distribution Sampling**: Implemented sophisticated mathematical samplers including Box-Muller transform for Gaussian, polar coordinates for rings, grid positioning with jitter
- **State Persistence Strategy**: Used existing Zustand store pattern for consistency with rest of application
- **AI Collaboration Approach**: Leveraged each AI's strengths - Claude for state management, GPT5 for mathematical algorithms, Claude 3.5 for synchronization details

## Context for Next Session

All major issues resolved in this session:

1. Grid layout positions now persist across page reloads
2. Complete distribution controls system implemented with 5 distribution types
3. Coordinate system clustering issue fixed with proper physics-canvas mapping
4. Initial particle visualization synchronized with selected distribution patterns
5. Ready for telegraph equation verification with properly functioning density calculations

## Repository Extraction and Deployment Work

### C9: Standalone Repository Setup and Vercel Deployment

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- **Claude**: Used git subtree to extract code directory from main qc-diffusion repository with complete commit history from 72e18 onwards
- **Claude**: Created new GitHub repository at https://github.com/space-cadet/qc-diffusion-code
- **Claude**: Copied graph-core and graph-ui packages from spin-network-app to eliminate external path dependencies
- **Claude**: Updated frontend/package.json to reference local graph-core package at `../packages/graph-core`
- **Claude**: Created vercel.json configuration with proper monorepo setup (moved to frontend directory)
- **Claude**: Fixed Vercel schema validation errors by removing invalid `rootDirectory` property
- **Claude**: Resolved directory structure issues for Vercel build process

**Status Change**: â¬œ PLANNED â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

**Current Issues**:
- pnpm lockfile out of sync after adding local graph-core dependency
- Node version compatibility issues preventing lockfile regeneration
- ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE error blocking Vercel deployment

## Files Modified (Repository Setup)
- `frontend/package.json` - Updated to use local graph-core dependency
- `frontend/vercel.json` - Created and configured for monorepo deployment
- `packages/graph-core/` - Copied from spin-network-app
- `packages/graph-ui/` - Copied from spin-network-app

## Next Session Priorities

1. **URGENT**: Fix pnpm lockfile synchronization to enable Vercel deployment
2. Resolve Node.js version compatibility issues with corepack
3. Complete successful Vercel deployment and verify application functionality
4. Implement telegraph equation verification using corrected density profile calculations
5. Add temporal evolution tracking for wave front analysis
