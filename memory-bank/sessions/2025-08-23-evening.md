## Focus Task

C5b, C8: Grid Layout Persistence + Distribution Controls System + Coordinate System Fixes
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: ~1.5 hours

## Tasks Worked On

### C5b: Random Walk UI Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- **Claude**: Fixed React Grid Layout panel positions/sizes not persisting between page reloads by adding `randomWalkSimLayouts` state to Zustand store in `appStore.ts`
- **GPT5**: Implemented comprehensive particle distribution controls with 5 distribution types (uniform, gaussian, ring, stripe, grid)
- **GPT5**: Added conditional rendering of distribution controls for continuum mode only in `ParameterPanel.tsx`
- **GPT5**: Extended `SimulatorParams` interface with distribution fields and implemented sophisticated distribution sampling methods
- **Claude 3.5**: Fixed final synchronization issue ensuring initial particle visualization matches selected distribution immediately after initialization
  **Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

### C8: Density Profile Calculation Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- **GPT5**: Fixed density profile clustering at corners by correcting coordinate mapping in `RandomWalkSimulator.ts` initialization
- **GPT5**: Ensured proper coordinate conversion flow: canvas â†’ physics (ParticleManager) â†’ density calculation uses physics coordinates
- **GPT5**: Added proper canvas size tracking and propagation to ParticleManager for correct coordinate transformations
- **GPT5**: Made `mapToCanvas()` method public in `ParticleManager.ts` for visualization synchronization
  **Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added `randomWalkSimLayouts` state and persistence by Claude
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - Integrated persisted layouts from store by Claude
- `frontend/src/components/ParameterPanel.tsx` - Added distribution controls UI with conditional rendering by GPT5
- `frontend/src/physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts` - Extended interface, added distribution sampling, fixed coordinate initialization by GPT5
- `frontend/src/physics/ParticleManager.ts` - Made `mapToCanvas()` public for visualization sync by GPT5

## Key Decisions Made

- **Coordinate System Architecture**: Established clear separation between canvas coordinates (0,canvasWidth) used for UI and physics coordinates (-200,+200) used internally
- **Distribution Sampling**: Implemented sophisticated mathematical samplers including Box-Muller transform for Gaussian, polar coordinates for rings, grid positioning with jitter
- **State Persistence Strategy**: Used existing Zustand store pattern for consistency with rest of application
- **AI Collaboration Approach**: Leveraged each AI's strengths - Claude for state management, GPT5 for mathematical algorithms, Claude 3.5 for synchronization details

## Context for Next Session

All major issues resolved in this session:

1. Grid layout positions now persist across page reloads
2. Complete distribution controls system implemented with 5 distribution types
3. Coordinate system clustering issue fixed with proper physics-canvas mapping
4. Initial particle visualization synchronized with selected distribution patterns
5. Ready for telegraph equation verification with properly functioning density calculations

## Next Session Priorities

1. Implement telegraph equation verification using corrected density profile calculations
2. Add temporal evolution tracking for wave front analysis
3. Complete observer pattern integration for real-time numerical observables
