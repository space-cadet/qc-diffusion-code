## Focus Task
C4: Fix Pause Button Functionality
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: ~30 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### C4: Fix Pause Button Functionality
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Analyzed pause button issue - had no effect on simulation
- Identified root causes: missing WebGL pause handling, backend state persistence, frontend/backend sync
- Solution implemented by Deepseek v3 + Claude 3.7 with proper architecture
- Backend: Added params storage and pause state toggle with confirmation messages
- Frontend: Fixed handlePause to work with both WebGL and WebSocket solvers
- UI: Simplified button to show "Pause"/"Resume" dynamically without disabled state
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `backend/api.py` - Added params storage, pause state toggle, and state synchronization
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Fixed handlePause for WebGL, added pause_state message handling
- `frontend/src/PlotComponent.tsx` - Updated pause button UI and behavior
- `frontend/src/BottomControls.tsx` - Updated pause button UI consistency
- `frontend/src/types.ts` - Added pause_state to WebSocketMessage type

## Key Decisions Made
- Reused existing runAnimation/stop methods for WebGL rather than adding new pause/resume methods
- Backend maintains simulation parameters during pause for proper resume functionality
- Unified pause behavior across both WebGL and WebSocket solvers
- Dynamic button text approach rather than separate pause/resume buttons

## Context for Next Session
Task C4 completed successfully. The pause button now works correctly for both solver types with proper state management and synchronization.

### C5: Random Walk Derivation of Telegraph Equation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Created new task C5 for implementing random walk simulation that demonstrates telegraph equation emergence
- Added task to master registry with dependency on C1
- Updated session cache to reflect new active task
- Ready to begin implementation planning phase
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

## Files Modified
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added C5 task entry and details
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Updated active task count and task registry
- `memory-bank/sessions/2025-08-20-night.md` - Updated with C5 progress

## Next Session Priorities
1. Create implementation outline for C5: Random walk derivation
2. Continue work on C3: GPU AMR integration tessellation approach  
3. Progress C1: Wheeler-DeWitt equation implementations
4. Review C2: VisualPDE GPU solver integration status
