## Focus Task
**C28**: Simplicial Growth Code Verification and Memory Bank Update

## Active Tasks

### C28: Simplicial Growth Code Verification
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress**:
1. ✅ Verified all code changes from summary match actual implementation
2. ✅ Confirmed Session 1 changes: Extended types, enhanced controller, fixed visualization, created PachnerMoveTester, enhanced 3D moves
3. ✅ Confirmed Session 2 partial changes: Task files created (C28a, C28b, C28c, C28d)
4. ⚠️ Identified discrepancy: Implementation docs NOT created as claimed
5. 🔄 Update memory bank with correct information

## Context and Working State

Verified actual code implementation against summary claims. All code changes are correct and functional:
- simplicial.ts: Dimension type (2|3), vertexPositions, move counts
- SimplicialGrowthController.ts: Dimension-aware initialization, 2D Pachner moves
- PachnerMoveTester.tsx: Dimension-aware move selection and simulation
- SimplicialVisualization.tsx: Stored geometric positions for 2D

Documentation discrepancy identified:
- Summary claims 4 new implementation docs created (simplicial-shared-aspects.md, simplicial-2d-core.md, simplicial-3d-core.md, simplicial-integration.md)
- Actual state: Only 2 docs exist (simplicial-growth-algorithm.md, simplicial-growth-ui-architecture.md)
- Task files C28a, C28b, C28c, C28d created as claimed

## Critical Files
- `memory-bank/tmp/chat-summaries-29-01-26-000200.md`: Summary of implementation work
- `frontend/src/lab/types/simplicial.ts`: Verified - Dimension type, vertexPositions
- `frontend/src/lab/controllers/SimplicialGrowthController.ts`: Verified - Dimension-aware initialization
- `frontend/src/lab/components/PachnerMoveTester.tsx`: Verified - Dimension-aware moves
- `frontend/src/lab/components/SimplicialVisualization.tsx`: Verified - Stored positions
- `memory-bank/tasks/C28.md`: Master task with subtasks
- `memory-bank/tasks/C28a.md`: Simplicial Foundational Core Implementation
- `memory-bank/tasks/C28b.md`: 2D Simplicial Pachner Moves Implementation
- `memory-bank/tasks/C28c.md`: 3D Simplicial Pachner Moves Implementation
- `memory-bank/tasks/C28d.md`: Simplicial Core Integration and Migration

## Memory Bank Updates
- Updated `memory-bank/edit_history.md` with verification entry
- Updated `memory-bank/session_cache.md` with current session
- Created `memory-bank/sessions/2026-01-29-morning.md` session file

## Session Notes

**Key Findings**:
- Summary Session 1 claims are ACCURATE - all code changes verified
- Summary Session 2 claims are PARTIALLY INACCURATE:
  - Task files created: CORRECT
  - Implementation docs created: INCORRECT (4 claimed, 0 actually created)
- Original implementation docs (simplicial-growth-algorithm.md, simplicial-growth-ui-architecture.md) exist and are correct

**Next Steps**:
- Complete memory bank updates with correct information
- Document discrepancy in C28 task file
- Verify all memory bank files are consistent

**Completion Status**: Verification complete, memory bank updates in progress.
