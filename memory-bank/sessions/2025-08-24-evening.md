## Focus Task
T5b: CPU Usage Elimination and Performance Optimization
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T5b: Random Walk UI Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Resolved high CPU usage when simulation paused/stopped through comprehensive animation control
- Implemented simulation status-gated animation in ParticleCanvas - single frame draw when not running, no continuous RAF
- Disabled tsParticles internal ticker completely with autoPlay: false and explicit container.pause()
- Added comprehensive rendering control in RandomWalkSim with simReady flag and renderEnabledRef
- Fixed observable registration race conditions with simReady prop and isRegistered gating
- Enhanced tab visibility handling for battery conservation during background operation
- Added extensive debug logging to trace animation lifecycle and cleanup events
- Optimized useDensityVisualization by removing unnecessary dependency updates
**Status Change**: ✅ COMPLETED (final optimization)

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - Added simReady state, renderEnabledRef control, visibility handlers, enhanced pause/resume effects
- `frontend/src/components/ObservablesPanel.tsx` - Added simReady prop, isRegistered local flag, gated observable registration and polling  
- `frontend/src/components/ParticleCanvas.tsx` - Implemented status-gated animation, single frame draws for non-running states, debug logging
- `frontend/src/config/tsParticlesConfig.ts` - Disabled internal ticker with autoPlay: false, explicit container.pause()
- `frontend/src/hooks/useDensityVisualization.ts` - Removed simulatorRef.current from effect dependencies

## Key Decisions Made
- Complete elimination of background animation loops when simulation not running for maximum CPU efficiency
- Maintained proper animation functionality while preventing all unnecessary rendering cycles
- Comprehensive race condition prevention between simulator initialization and component dependencies
- Debug logging retained for future troubleshooting and performance monitoring

## Context for Next Session
T5b implementation fully completed with comprehensive CPU usage elimination. All performance issues resolved:
- High CPU usage when paused/stopped eliminated completely
- Observable registration timing issues resolved with proper dependency gating
- Animation loops properly controlled with single-frame draws for static states
- Tab visibility handling implemented for battery conservation
System now maintains optimal performance in all states while preserving full functionality.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Continue development on remaining active physics tasks (T7 Observer pattern, T3 GPU AMR)
2. Test complete system performance under various simulation conditions
3. Monitor for any remaining performance issues or edge cases
4. Proceed with telegraph equation verification and advanced physics features
