## Focus Task
C15: Physics Engine Architecture Migration - Runtime engine toggle implementation
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### C15: Physics Engine Architecture Migration
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Added runtime UI toggle button in random walk page header for switching between legacy and new physics engines
- Implemented useNewEngine state in app store with persistence across browser sessions
- Modified RandomWalkSimulator constructor to accept useNewEngine parameter via intersection types
- Updated useEffect dependency array to recreate simulator when engine toggle changes
- Added visual feedback with color-coded button states (gray for LEGACY, green for NEW)
- Comprehensive architecture analysis and execution flow mapping completed
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (runtime toggle phase completed)

### META-1: Memory Bank Maintenance and Updates  
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Updated activeContext.md with current focus on C15 physics engine toggle implementation
- Enhanced projectbrief.md with dual physics engine architecture details
- Updated techContext.md physics integration section with engine selection UI
- Expanded systemPatterns.md with comprehensive dual engine architecture analysis
- Added complete architecture map and execution flow documentation to random-walk-engine-plan.md
- Updated all timestamps to current system time (2025-09-03 21:XX IST)
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ ACTIVE â†’ ðŸ”„ ACTIVE (documentation updated)

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - Added toggle button in page header with state management
- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added useNewEngine boolean state with persistence
- `frontend/src/physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts` - Modified constructor to accept engine flag parameter
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Updated current focus and working state
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Enhanced physics implementation section
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Updated physics engine integration details  
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Expanded dual engine architecture documentation
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/random-walk-engine-plan.md` - Added comprehensive architecture analysis
- `memory-bank/tasks/C15.md` - Updated progress log with runtime toggle completion
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated master task registry

## Key Decisions Made
- Used intersection types for RandomWalkSimulator constructor to maintain backwards compatibility
- Placed toggle button in page header for prominent visibility and access
- Implemented persistent state storage via Zustand for seamless user experience
- Added comprehensive debugging information to execution flow documentation
- Created complete architecture mapping for both legacy and new engine paths

## Context for Next Session
Runtime physics engine toggle is fully functional with visual feedback. Next priorities:
1. Debug missing console logs in legacy engine execution path
2. Investigate animation loop and physics stepping integration
3. Verify particle movement and collision detection in both engines
4. Complete phase-based execution model implementation

## Next Session Priorities
1. Test both engine paths with console log analysis to verify correct execution
2. Debug particle animation and physics integration issues
3. Implement remaining architecture migration phases
4. Validate engine switching behavior and performance
