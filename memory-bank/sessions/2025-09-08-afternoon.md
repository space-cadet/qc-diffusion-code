## Focus
C19 Boundary System Architecture Cleanup + Memory Bank Updates

## Objectives
- Review boundary condition implementation changes since last commit
- Update memory bank with current implementation status
- Clean up deprecated BoundaryPhase architecture
- Document session changes for future reference

## Tasks Completed

### Memory Bank Updates
- Updated C19 task file with current implementation status (IN PROGRESS, not completed)
- Updated master tasks.md with correct timestamps and status
- Enhanced particle-boundary-condition-plan.md with 2025-09-08 session changes
- Documented architecture improvements and strategy updates

### Code Analysis
- Reviewed 14 changed files since last commit
- Identified removal of BoundaryPhase.ts and StrategyOrchestrator updates
- Documented BoundaryManager integration across all strategies
- Noted particle filtering improvements and diagnostics additions

## Key Changes Documented

### Architecture Improvements
- Deleted BoundaryPhase.ts - boundary handling now integrated directly into strategies
- Updated StrategyOrchestrator to remove boundary phase execution
- Enhanced InterparticleCollisionStrategy2D with BoundaryManager integration
- Fixed StrategyFactory to use actual canvas dimensions from ParameterManager

### Strategy Updates
- BallisticStrategy: Added absorption handling (sets isActive=false when absorbed)
- CTRWStrategy1D and CTRWStrategy2D: Unified update paths to avoid code duplication
- Added boundary config validation warnings in strategy constructors
- Improved particle filtering in tsParticlesConfig to handle inactive particles

### Diagnostics
- Added store size diagnostic in ObservablesPanel
- Enhanced initialization logging in RandomWalkSimulator
- Improved particle syncing with active/inactive state handling

## Next Steps
- Update session cache with current session
- Update edit history with boundary condition changes
- Generate commit message for boundary condition implementation

## Files Modified
- memory-bank/tasks/C19.md
- memory-bank/tasks.md
- memory-bank/implementation-details/particle-boundary-condition-plan.md

## Context
Building on C19 boundary condition implementation work. Focus on documenting current state accurately without making assumptions about completion status.
