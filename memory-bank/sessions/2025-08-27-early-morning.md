# Session: 2025-08-27 Early Morning

**Started**: 2025-08-27 01:30:00 IST
**Focus**: C2a - Boundary Conditions Implementation and Testing
**Status**: Active

## Session Overview

Memory bank update workflow execution for current boundary conditions testing work and git branch management planning.

## Tasks Worked On

### C2a: PDE Solver Methods and Boundary Conditions
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- **Focus**: Boundary conditions implementation and testing infrastructure
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `memory-bank/tasks/C2a.md` - Updated with testing infrastructure context
  - `memory-bank/implementation-details/boundary-conditions/dirichlet-bcs-guide.md` - Implementation notes
  - `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated task status
  - `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Current session info

## Key Developments

### Testing Infrastructure Added
- Comprehensive test suite for boundary condition implementations
- `frontend/src/webgl/__tests__/boundaryConditions.test.ts` for BC validation
- `frontend/src/webgl/__tests__/solverShaders.test.ts` for shader generation testing
- Jest configuration updates and test scripts in package.json
- Babel configuration for test environment support

### Git Branch Management Request
- User requested creating `boundary-conditions` branch from current HEAD
- Plan to move recent commits to new branch and reset main to `cec09f4`
- Current status: Already on `boundary-conditions` branch with uncommitted changes
- Need clarification on handling uncommitted work before proceeding

### Boundary Conditions Implementation Status
- DirichletBC class refactored with `sampleWithBC` pattern
- Shader integration completed for ForwardEuler, CrankNicolson, LaxWendroff solvers
- Boundary detection using texel-based coordinate checking
- Post-processing pass for direct boundary value enforcement

## Files Modified This Session

1. `memory-bank/tasks/C2b.md` - Updated with testing infrastructure context
2. `memory-bank/implementation-details/boundary-conditions/dirichlet-bcs-guide.md` - Added implementation notes
3. `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated timestamps and task status
4. `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Current session information
5. `memory-bank/sessions/2025-08-27-early-morning.md` - This session file

## Next Steps

1. Resolve git branch management approach with user
2. Continue boundary condition testing validation
3. Implement flexible BC system UI controls
4. Complete per-equation solver selection interface

## Context Notes

- Already on `boundary-conditions` branch with significant uncommitted changes
- Test infrastructure in place for validation
- Memory bank documentation updated with current implementation status
- Ready to proceed with git operations once user clarifies approach
