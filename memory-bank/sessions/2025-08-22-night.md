## Focus Task

C8: Density Profile Calculation Implementation
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: ~2 hours

## Tasks Worked On

### C8: Density Profile Calculation Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Implemented getDensityProfile2D method in RandomWalkSimulator for 2D spatial binning
- Created useDensityVisualization hook for canvas-based heatmap rendering
- Updated DensityComparison component with real-time density visualization
- Added density history recording with 100 snapshot limit for temporal analysis
- Implemented wavefront speed analysis for telegraph equation verification
- Integrated real-time controls (Update, Auto ON/OFF, Recording toggle)
  **Status Change**: ⬜ PLANNED → ✅ COMPLETED

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts` - Added 2D density calculation and history tracking
- `frontend/src/hooks/useDensityVisualization.ts` - Created canvas rendering hook for heatmaps
- `frontend/src/components/DensityComparison.tsx` - Updated with 2D visualization and controls
- `frontend/src/physics/interfaces/RandomWalkStrategy.ts` - Added getParameters method
- `frontend/src/physics/strategies/CTRWStrategy.ts` - Implemented getParameters method

## Key Decisions Made

- Used 2D spatial binning with configurable bin size for density calculation
- Implemented blue-to-red color mapping for density visualization
- Added center-of-mass tracking for wavefront speed measurement to verify telegraph equation
- Created density history recording system for temporal analysis
- Integrated real-time update controls directly in DensityComparison panel

## Issues Identified

- Numerical artifacts at boundaries due to periodic boundary wrapping effects
- Extra bin creation causing artificial density peaks at domain edges
- Coordinate system alignment between physics simulation and visualization canvas
- Normalization issues in density calculation affecting accuracy

## Context for Next Session

Density profile implementation completed but identified boundary artifacts that create false density peaks at corners. The periodic boundary conditions cause particles to wrap around domain edges, creating artificial accumulation that appears as high density in visualization. Need to investigate proper handling of periodic boundaries in density calculation or consider alternative boundary conditions for accurate telegraph equation verification.

## Next Session Priorities

1. Investigate and fix boundary artifacts in density profile calculation
2. Implement proper unwrapping of periodic boundary positions for density analysis
3. Add export functionality for density data to enable external analysis
4. Consider implementing density comparison with analytical telegraph equation solutions
5. Add cross-sectional density plots for 1D analysis of 2D density fields
