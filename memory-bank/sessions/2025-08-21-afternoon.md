## Focus Task

C5c: Random Walk Physics Implementation
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 0 minutes

## Tasks Worked On

### C5c: Random Walk Physics Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Session started with CTRW physics implementation review
- Examined git changes showing completed CTRW implementation with ParticleManager integration
- Major implementation completed: exponential collision timing, particle state management, tsParticles bridge
- Current focus: updateParticlesWithCTRW function integration and density calculation implementation

## Files Modified

- None yet (session just started)

## Key Decisions Made

- None yet (session just started)

## Context for Next Session

CTRW physics engine implementation is largely complete with:
- ParticleManager class bridging tsParticles and custom physics
- Exponential collision timing with Poisson process
- Complete TypeScript type definitions
- Integration via updateParticlesWithCTRW function

Next priorities:
1. Implement density profile calculation for telegraph comparison
2. Add simulation history recording and replay functionality
3. Optimize performance for large particle counts
4. Add educational parameter demonstrations

## Session Notes

Started by reviewing git changes since last commit, showing significant progress on CTRW implementation. The physics engine is now functional with proper collision mechanics and particle management.
