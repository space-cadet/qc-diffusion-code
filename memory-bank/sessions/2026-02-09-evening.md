## Session Overview
**Focus**: Python Backend Environment Setup and Documentation
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Period**: Evening

## Work Completed

### Python Backend Environment Setup Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation and task for Python backend development environment setup, addressing the gap in development workflow guidance.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Task Creation (T32)**
   - Created `memory-bank/tasks/T32.md` with task template compliance
   - Defined scope: Python backend environment setup and documentation
   - Set priority: MEDIUM (supporting infrastructure)
   - Status: IN PROGRESS

2. **Environment Setup Documentation**
   - Created `memory-bank/implementation-details/python-backend-environment-setup.md`
   - Documented conda vs venv setup processes with troubleshooting
   - Added common issues and solutions (pde module import, conda in scripts)
   - Included deployment architecture separation guidance

3. **Vercel Deployment Plan Update**
   - Updated `memory-bank/implementation-details/vercel-deployment-plan.md`
   - Added Python environment setup section
   - Documented conda integration for local development
   - Clarified backend deployment separation strategy

#### Key Technical Decisions

- **Conda over venv**: Recommended for scientific computing dependencies (py-pde, numpy)
- **Module Import Fix**: Documented py-pde import issues and solutions
- **Script Integration**: Updated package.json to use `conda run` instead of `conda activate`
- **Deployment Separation**: Confirmed Vercel frontend-only with separate backend hosting

#### Files Modified
- `memory-bank/tasks/T32.md` - New task file created
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/python-backend-environment-setup.md` - New documentation
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/vercel-deployment-plan.md` - Updated with Python section
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added T32 to task registry
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Updated current session and task registry

## Task Status Updates
- T32: Python Backend Environment Setup and Documentation - 🔄 IN PROGRESS

## Notes
- Focused on essential setup issues, not peripheral concerns
- Emphasized conda for better scientific package dependency management
- Documented deployment architecture clearly for future reference
- All updates follow memory bank template compliance v6.12

## Next Steps
- Complete any remaining documentation if needed
- Test documented setup process for accuracy
- Consider creating additional troubleshooting guides as issues arise
