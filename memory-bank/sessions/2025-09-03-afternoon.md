## Focus Task
C7a: Modular Transparent Observable System Redesign
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Advanced Implementation Phase
**Time Spent**: ~2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### C7a: Modular Transparent Observable System Redesign
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Fixed custom observable data display issues - resolved "No data" problem with unified polling architecture
- Implemented single-timer polling system with 25ms resolution (Î”_min approach) replacing multiple timer inefficiencies
- Added inline syntax parser supporting comma-separated observable definitions: `name: particleCount, reduce: count`
- Migrated particle count and kinetic energy built-in observables to text-based system successfully
- Eliminated console warning floods about unregistered observers through proper ID handling
**Status Change**: âœ… COMPLETED â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (Advanced Implementation Phase)

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/useObservablesPolling.ts` - Complete rewrite with single-timer architecture and custom observable support
- `frontend/src/physics/observables/TextObservableParser.ts` - Added `parseInline()` method and syntax auto-detection
- `frontend/src/components/observablesConfig.ts` - Converted particle count and kinetic energy to text-based definitions
- `frontend/src/components/ObservablesPanel.tsx` - Updated registration logic to handle text-based built-in observables

## Key Decisions Made
- **Single-Timer Architecture**: Implemented user's suggested Î”_min = 25ms approach with observable-specific `nextPollTime` tracking for optimal performance
- **Inline Syntax Support**: Added comma-separated syntax alongside block syntax to simplify observable definitions
- **Built-In Migration Strategy**: Successfully demonstrated text-based system can replace hardcoded observable classes
- **Unified Polling System**: All observables (built-in and custom) now use same polling mechanism and data structures

## Context for Next Session
Migration approach proven successful with particle count and kinetic energy conversions. System now supports both inline (`name: x, reduce: y`) and block (`observable "x" { reduce: y }`) syntax. Custom observables display live data correctly during simulation. Remaining work: convert momentum and MSD observables to text system, complete unified architecture.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Migrate momentum observable to text-based system with proper velocity component handling
2. Migrate MSD observable to text-based system with displacement calculation support
3. Remove unused observable class files once all built-ins are migrated
