# Session: 2025-09-03 Morning (10:08:43 IST)

## Summary
This session focused on debugging and enhancing the text-based observable system. The primary goals were to fix persistent `NaN` values in observable calculations, implement semantic validation for user-defined expressions, and improve UI feedback. The user also performed a significant refactor to unify the polling mechanism for all observables.

## Key Implementations

### 1. Bug Fix: `NaN` in Text Observables
- **Issue**: Custom observables returned `NaN` because `TextObservable` instances were created with `undefined` bounds.
- **Root Cause**: `RandomWalkSimulator` instantiated `ObservableManager` without passing the required canvas dimensions.
- **Fix**: Modified `RandomWalkSimulator.ts` to pass `{ width, height }` from `ParameterManager` to the `ObservableManager` constructor.

### 2. Semantic Validation for Expressions
- **Issue**: The system allowed syntactically correct but semantically incorrect expressions (e.g., using `velocity.x` instead of `velocity.vx`), leading to silent failures and `NaN` results.
- **Fix**: Enhanced `TextObservableParser.ts`:
    - `validateExpression` now extracts identifiers from the expression string.
    - It checks these identifiers against a new `allowedProperties` set that mirrors the actual evaluation context from `ExpressionEvaluator`.
    - Invalid identifiers now trigger a validation error (e.g., "Unknown identifiers: velocity.x").
    - `getAvailableProperties` was corrected to list the valid property names (`velocity.vx`, `velocity.vy`).

### 3. UI Help Text Enhancement
- **Issue**: The help text for custom observables was minimal and listed incorrect variable names.
- **Fix**: Updated `CustomObservablesPanel.tsx` to provide a comprehensive list of available properties and practical examples, guiding users to write valid expressions.

### 4. Unified Polling and Data Structure (User Refactor)
- **Change**: The user refactored `ObservablesPanel.tsx` to consolidate observable polling. The separate state and `setInterval` logic for custom observables were removed.
- **New Architecture**: Both built-in and custom observables are now polled through a single, unified `useObservablesPolling` hook, simplifying state management and reducing potential for errors.
- **Data Structure Alignment**: The user modified `TextObservable.ts` so that `calculate()` returns a structured object `{ value, timestamp, metadata }`, matching the format of built-in observables and simplifying data handling in the UI.

## Results
- The critical bug causing `NaN` values in text observables is resolved.
- The system now provides immediate feedback for invalid variable names in expressions.
- The UI is more user-friendly, with clear documentation on how to write custom observables.
- The polling architecture is cleaner and more robust after the user's refactoring.
