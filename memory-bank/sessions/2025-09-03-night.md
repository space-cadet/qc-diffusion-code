## Focus Task
C18: Streaming Observable Framework Implementation
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: 3 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### C18: Streaming Observable Framework Implementation
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- âœ… Created StreamObservableManager.ts with EventEmitter architecture for real-time data emission
- âœ… Implemented stream-useObservableStream.ts hook replacing complex polling logic with event subscriptions
- âœ… Built stream-ObservablesPanel.tsx with streaming architecture and automatic observable registration
- âœ… Added useStreamingObservables feature flag to appStore with UI toggle button
- âœ… Integrated conditional manager instantiation in RandomWalkSimulator based on framework selection
- âœ… Added conditional rendering in RandomWalkSim.tsx to switch between polling and streaming panels
- âœ… Exposed simulator to browser console for debugging support
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

### C7a: Modular Transparent Observable System Redesign
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- âœ… Enhanced with streaming framework integration as advanced alternative to polling system
- âœ… Maintained backward compatibility with existing polling architecture
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED (streaming integration phase)

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - Added StreamObservablesPanel import, useStreamingObservables toggle button, conditional panel rendering, simulator debugging exposure
- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added useStreamingObservables flag, setUseStreamingObservables action, interface export for RandomWalkUIState
- `frontend/src/physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts` - Added StreamObservableManager import, conditional manager instantiation, enhanced step method with streaming support
- `frontend/src/components/CustomObservablesPanel.tsx` - Minor updates for streaming framework compatibility
- `frontend/src/components/ObservablesPanel.tsx` - Enhanced for feature comparison with streaming panel
- `frontend/src/components/observablesConfig.ts` - Configuration updates for streaming framework integration
- `frontend/src/components/useObservablesPolling.ts` - Maintained as alternative to streaming approach
- `frontend/src/physics/ParticleManager.ts` - Updates for streaming observable compatibility
- `frontend/src/physics/observables/ExpressionEvaluator.ts` - Enhanced for streaming framework integration
- `frontend/src/physics/observables/TextObservableParser.ts` - Parser enhancements for streaming observables

## Files Created
- `frontend/src/components/stream-ObservablesPanel.tsx` - Streaming version of ObservablesPanel with EventEmitter subscriptions and automatic registration (147 lines)
- `frontend/src/components/stream-useObservableStream.ts` - React hook for streaming data subscriptions replacing polling logic (25 lines)
- `frontend/src/physics/stream-ObservableManager.ts` - EventEmitter-based observable manager with real-time data emission (120 lines)

## Key Decisions Made
- EventEmitter pattern chosen for push-based observable updates over polling
- Feature flag approach enables A/B testing between polling and streaming architectures
- Maintained complete backward compatibility with existing polling system
- Streaming observables emit during simulation step for real-time performance
- Simple event subscription model replaces complex interval-based polling logic

## Context for Next Session
C18 implementation complete with working feature toggle system. Both polling and streaming observable frameworks functional. Ready for performance validation and potential adoption decision.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Performance testing between polling vs streaming approaches (CPU usage, update frequency)
2. Edge case testing (rapid start/stop, multiple observables, simulation state changes)
3. Consider permanent adoption of streaming framework or maintain dual system
