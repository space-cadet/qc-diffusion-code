## Focus Task
C6: Random Walk Physics Engine Redesign
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: 1 hour

## Tasks Worked On
### C6: Random Walk Physics Engine Redesign
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Implemented complete Strategy pattern refactoring
- Created `RandomWalkStrategy` interface with `CTRWStrategy` implementation
- Refactored `RandomWalkSimulator` to use strategy pattern
- Added modular physics architecture with `/interfaces`, `/strategies`, `/utils` directories
- Implemented `CircularBuffer` utility for trajectory tracking
- Added comprehensive Jest testing framework with TypeScript support
- Updated frontend integration to use new modular architecture
- Cleaned up console logging and improved state management
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

### C5c: Random Walk Physics Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Advanced physics implementation with modular strategy architecture
- Completed density calculation integration
- Connected physics engine to UI parameter controls
- Added comprehensive testing infrastructure
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (advanced)

## Files Modified
- `frontend/package.json` - Added Jest testing dependencies and Three.js library
- `frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated package lock with new dependencies
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx` - Removed high-level ts-particles imports, updated callback signature
- `frontend/src/components/ParticleCanvas.tsx` - Complete rewrite with low-level API and manual engine control
- `frontend/src/config/tsParticlesConfig.ts` - Replaced high-level config with low-level engine functions
- `frontend/src/physics/ParticleManager.ts` - Strategy pattern integration and improved collision tracking
- `frontend/src/physics/RandomWalkSimulator.ts` - Complete refactor to use strategy pattern
- `frontend/src/physics/types/CollisionEvent.ts` - Enhanced collision event types
- `frontend/src/physics/types/Particle.ts` - Improved particle interface

## Files Removed
- `frontend/src/hooks/useParticlesEngine.ts` - Moved to backup, no longer needed with low-level API

## Files Created
- `frontend/jest.config.js` - Jest configuration for TypeScript and React testing
- `frontend/src/physics/index.ts` - Physics module exports
- `frontend/src/physics/interfaces/RandomWalkStrategy.ts` - Strategy pattern interface
- `frontend/src/physics/strategies/CTRWStrategy.ts` - CTRW implementation using strategy pattern
- `frontend/src/physics/utils/CircularBuffer.ts` - Trajectory storage utility
- `frontend/src/physics/utils/Vector.ts` - Vector math utilities
- `frontend/src/physics/__tests__/CTRWStrategy.test.ts` - Unit tests for CTRW strategy
- `frontend/src/physics/__tests__/CircularBuffer.test.ts` - Unit tests for circular buffer
- `frontend/src/physics/__tests__/integration.test.ts` - Integration tests

## Key Decisions Made
- Implemented Strategy pattern over inheritance hierarchy for simplicity
- Added comprehensive testing framework with Jest and TypeScript support
- Created modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Disabled default tsParticles movement to rely purely on CTRW physics
- Added Three.js dependency for future 3D graphics capabilities

## Context for Next Session
Task C6 completed successfully - physics engine now uses modular strategy pattern with proper state preservation. C5c physics implementation significantly advanced with testing framework and improved architecture.

### C6a: Rewrite ts-particles Component Using Low-Level API
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Removed all high-level ts-particles imports (Particles component, initParticlesEngine)
- Implemented manual engine initialization with tsParticles.load()
- Created direct particle creation/management system with createParticleContainer()
- Replaced React wrapper with canvas-based rendering
- Added custom animation loop using requestAnimationFrame
- Fixed particle iteration error by properly accessing container.particles.array
- Eliminated animation conflicts between ts-particles built-in movement and physics simulation
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ NEW â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Issues Identified
- Dual animation loops still present between ParticleCanvasComponent and RandomWalkSim
- Physics engine timing not properly connected to single animation loop
- Need to consolidate animation control for proper physics integration

## Next Session Priorities
1. Fix dual animation loop issue between ParticleCanvasComponent and RandomWalkSim
2. Connect physics engine timing to single unified animation loop
3. Continue C5c with simulation history recording and replay functionality
4. Add data export capabilities for density profiles and particle trajectories
5. Implement performance optimizations for large particle counts
