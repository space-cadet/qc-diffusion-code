## Focus Task

T5c: Random Walk Physics Implementation
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 45 minutes

## Tasks Worked On

### T5c: Random Walk Physics Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Examined current random walk physics engine structure and identified design issues
- Analyzed class architecture problems: no state persistence, mixed responsibilities, tight coupling
- Created comprehensive redesign plan with abstract hierarchy and particle system refactor
- Documented complete implementation plan in `random-walk-class-redesign.md`
- Identified design pattern issues: inheritance overuse and unnecessary abstractions
  **Status Change**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS → 🔄 IN PROGRESS (analysis phase)

## Files Modified

- `memory-bank/implementation-details/random-walk-class-redesign.md` - Created comprehensive redesign documentation with motivation, goals, class hierarchy, particle structure, and implementation steps

## Key Decisions Made

- **Abstract hierarchy approach**: AbstractRandomWalk → TemporalRandomWalk/SpatialRandomWalk → concrete implementations
- **Particle redesign**: AbstractParticle → specialized particle types (CTRWParticle, GraphParticle, etc.)
- **Memory optimization**: Circular buffers for trajectory storage to prevent unbounded growth
- **Separation of concerns**: Extract GraphManager, PhysicsConfig from monolithic PhysicsRandomWalk
- **Factory pattern**: RandomWalkFactory for clean instantiation of different walk types

## Design Pattern Analysis

- Current proposal mixes Strategy, Template Method, Factory, and Bridge patterns
- Identified over-engineering issues: unnecessary inheritance levels, forced particle-walk coupling
- Alternative approaches considered: Entity-Component-System or pure Strategy pattern
- Need to simplify design to avoid artificial abstractions

## Context for Next Session

- Decision needed: Continue with abstract hierarchy approach or simplify to pure Strategy pattern
- Ready to begin implementation Phase 1 (abstract base classes) or redesign with simpler pattern
- Current PhysicsRandomWalk class needs refactoring to preserve state during parameter updates
- Animation toggle bug still present - particles reinitialize instead of freezing positions

## Next Session Priorities

1. Decide on final design pattern approach (hierarchy vs Strategy pattern)
2. Begin implementation of chosen approach starting with base abstractions
3. Address immediate state persistence issue in updateParameters() method

## Session Extension - T6: Random Walk Physics Engine Redesign

**Time Spent**: 20 minutes (extension)

### T6: Random Walk Physics Engine Redesign

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Created new task T6 for physics engine redesign separate from T5c implementation
- Documented comprehensive analysis of inheritance vs Strategy pattern approaches
- Refined particle interface cleanup to avoid over-engineering
- Removed artificial tight coupling between walk types and particle types
- Established unified Particle interface approach with strategy-managed state

**Status Change**: New task created - 🔄 IN PROGRESS

## Files Modified (Extension)

- `memory-bank/tasks/T6.md` - Created new task file for physics engine redesign
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added T6 to active tasks registry
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Added T6 to task registry and changed focus task
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/random-walk-class-redesign.md` - Refined particle interface approach

## Key Decisions Made (Extension)

- **Task separation**: Split redesign work into separate T6 task for better tracking
- **Strategy pattern preference**: Recommended over inheritance hierarchy for simplicity
- **Unified particle interface**: Single Particle interface across all walk types
- **Strategy-managed state**: Walk-specific state handled by strategies, not particle types

## Context for Next Session (Updated)

- T6 created as new task focusing on physics engine architecture redesign
- Strategy pattern approach documented and ready for implementation
- State persistence solution identified: swap strategies while preserving particles
- Ready to begin Phase 1: Extract RandomWalkStrategy interface
