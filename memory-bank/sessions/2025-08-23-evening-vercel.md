## Focus Task
**C9: Standalone Repository Setup and Vercel Deployment**

## Session Summary
Successfully resolved Vercel build and deployment issues for the qc-diffusion-code standalone repository through proper pnpm workspace configuration.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Vercel Build Log Analysis
- Examined `memory-bank/vercel-logs/vercel-build-log-23-08-2025-18-09-00.log`
- Identified root cause: missing pnpm workspace configuration causing packages/graph-core dependencies to not install
- TypeScript compilation errors due to missing modules (mathjs, graphology, graphology-generators)

### 2. pnpm Workspace Configuration
- Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml` at repository root
- Configured packages: frontend, backend, packages/*
- Enabled proper dependency resolution across workspace packages

### 3. Root Package Configuration
- Added convenience build script: `"build": "pnpm --filter qc-diffusion-frontend build"`
- Removed redundant dependencies from root package.json (graphology, graphology-types)
- Maintained packageManager specification for pnpm@10.14.0

### 4. Vercel Configuration Update
- Root Directory: repository root (instead of frontend subdirectory)
- Install Command: `pnpm install`
- Build Command: `pnpm --filter qc-diffusion-frontend build`
- Output Directory: `frontend/dist` (matching Vite's default output)

### 5. Local Build Verification
- Confirmed `pnpm build` runs successfully from repository root
- No TypeScript errors in packages/graph-core after workspace dependency resolution
- Build process now properly handles monorepo structure

## Technical Resolution Details

### Issue: Missing Dependencies in packages/graph-core
**Root Cause**: Without pnpm workspace configuration, `pnpm install` only installed frontend dependencies. When the build script ran `cd ../packages/graph-core && pnpm build`, the graph-core package had no node_modules.

**Solution**: pnpm-workspace.yaml enables workspace-wide dependency resolution, ensuring all packages get their dependencies during the initial `pnpm install`.

### Issue: Vercel Output Directory Mismatch
**Root Cause**: Vercel expected `public` directory but Vite outputs to `dist` by default.

**Solution**: Configured Vercel Output Directory to `frontend/dist` to match Vite's build output location.

## Files Modified
- `/pnpm-workspace.yaml` (created)
- `/package.json` (added build script, removed redundant deps)

## Files Analyzed
- `/memory-bank/vercel-logs/vercel-build-log-23-08-2025-18-09-00.log`
- `/packages/graph-core/package.json`
- `/frontend/package.json`
- `/frontend/vite.config.ts`
- `/packages/graph-core/src/core/GraphologyAdapter.ts`

## Deployment Status
âœ… **SUCCESSFUL** - Application now deploys and runs correctly on Vercel

## Next Steps
Task C9 completed successfully. The standalone qc-diffusion-code repository is now properly configured for Vercel deployment with:
- Functional monorepo workspace structure
- Proper dependency resolution
- Working build pipeline
- Production deployment capability

## Session Context
This session focused exclusively on resolving the final deployment blockers for task C9. The solution involved understanding pnpm workspace mechanics and Vercel's monorepo build requirements. The approach of using workspace configuration at the repository root proved more reliable than attempting to manage dependencies manually or using complex build scripts.
