## Objectives

- Fix animation loop architecture to follow physics engine migration plan
- Resolve console flooding from continuous tsParticles position sync logging
- Investigate and update physics strategy system to replace legacy ballistic strategy with newer implementation

## Tasks

- T15: Physics Engine Architecture Migration (RandomWalkSimulator Refactoring)
- Animation loop architecture fix
- Particle sync logging fix
- Strategy migration investigation

## Context

Working on T15 physics engine migration. Fixed critical animation loop issues where physics stepping was controlled by tab visibility instead of simulation state, causing continuous execution of LegacyBallisticStrategy.updateParticle() even when simulation was paused/reset.

## Work Completed

### Animation Loop Architecture Fix (Phase A/B Implementation)
- **Problem**: Two overlapping animation loops with incorrect state gating
- **Root Cause**: useParticlesLoader hook used tab visibility (`renderEnabledRef`) to control physics stepping instead of simulation running state
- **Solution**: Implemented proper two-phase architecture per migration plan:
  - Phase A (Physics): Controlled by `simulationStateRef.current?.isRunning`  
  - Phase B (Rendering): Controlled by `renderEnabledRef.current` (tab visibility)

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/hooks/useParticlesLoader.ts`: Fixed state path bug (`simulationStateRef.current?.current?.isRunning` → `simulationStateRef.current?.isRunning`), implemented proper two-phase animation loop with fixed physics timestep (0.01s) and time accumulation
- `frontend/src/components/ParticleCanvas.tsx`: Added delta time tracking and improved diagnostics, maintained separation between physics stepping (handled by useParticlesLoader) and rendering

### Console Logging Flood Fix
- **Problem**: `[tsParticles] Position sync` messages flooding console even when simulation paused/reset
- **Root Cause**: Diagnostic logging in `updateParticlesFromStrategies` ran continuously regardless of simulation state
- **Solution**: Added conditional logging based on simulation running state

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/config/tsParticlesConfig.ts`: Added `isSimulationRunning` parameter, gated diagnostic logging with `isSimulationRunning && (_diagFrameCounter % 60 === 0)`
- `frontend/src/components/ParticleCanvas.tsx`: Updated call to pass `simulationStatus === "running"`
- `frontend/src/RandomWalkSim.tsx`: Updated visibility and pause/play handlers to pass correct simulation state
- `frontend/src/hooks/useParticlesLoader.ts`: Updated to pass `simulationStateRef.current?.isRunning || false`
- `frontend/src/physics/utils/ParticleInitializer.ts`: Fixed erroneous top-level function call causing ReferenceError

### Strategy Migration Investigation
- **Finding**: New BallisticStrategy exists but implements `PhysicsStrategy` interface, incompatible with current `RandomWalkStrategy` system
- **Current State**: StrategyFactory continues using LegacyBallisticStrategy due to interface mismatch
- **Migration Status**: New strategy architecture incomplete - requires full PhysicsEngine migration or adapter implementation

## Technical Details

### Animation Loop Flow (Fixed)
```
useParticlesLoader animate() loop:
├── Phase A: Physics (if simulationState.isRunning)
│   ├── Fixed timestep: 0.01s
│   ├── Time accumulation for variable frame rates  
│   └── simulatorRef.current.step(physicsTimeStep)
└── Phase B: Rendering (if tab visible)
    ├── updateParticlesFromStrategies(container, true, isRunning)
    └── container.draw(false)
```

### State Separation (Corrected)
- **Physics Control**: `simulationStateRef.current?.isRunning` (simulation state)
- **Render Control**: `renderEnabledRef.current` (tab visibility)
- **Logging Control**: `isSimulationRunning` parameter (simulation state)

## Results

✅ Animation loop now properly follows migration plan two-phase architecture
✅ Physics stepping only occurs when simulation is running (not just tab visible)
✅ Console logging flood eliminated when simulation paused/reset
✅ LegacyBallisticStrategy.updateParticle() no longer called continuously
✅ Proper time management with fixed physics timestep and accumulation

## Next Steps

- Complete strategy migration by implementing RandomWalkStrategy interface for new BallisticStrategy
- Continue T15 physics engine migration plan phases
- Test boundary condition handling with fixed animation loop

## Work Summary

### Particle Sync Logging Fix

- Modified `updateParticlesFromStrategies` function in `tsParticlesConfig.ts` to include a new parameter `isSimulationRunning` to control diagnostic logging
- Updated all call sites of `updateParticlesFromStrategies` in various files to pass the correct simulation running state:
  - `ParticleCanvas.tsx`
  - `RandomWalkSim.tsx`
  - `useParticlesLoader.ts`
  - `ParticleInitializer.ts`
- Removed an erroneous top-level call to `updateParticlesFromStrategies(container, true, false)` in `ParticleInitializer.ts` where `container` was undefined, causing a runtime error

### Ballistic Strategy Migration Investigation

- Investigated why the legacy ballistic strategy code was still being called despite the existence of a newer ballistic strategy
- Found that the new `BallisticStrategy` implements a different interface (`PhysicsStrategy`) than the legacy one (`RandomWalkStrategy`)
- The new strategy lacks required methods and constructor signature expected by the current system
- The current system uses a factory (`StrategyFactory.ts`) that imports and creates the legacy ballistic strategy, not the new one
- Attempted to switch to the new strategy but reverted due to interface incompatibility and TypeScript errors
- Concluded that full migration to the new physics engine architecture is required before the new ballistic strategy can be used

## Next Steps

1. Complete the migration of the physics engine to fully adopt the new `PhysicsStrategy` interface
2. Adapt or rewrite the ballistic strategy to implement the required `RandomWalkStrategy` interface
3. Update the strategy factory to use the new ballistic strategy implementation
4. Test the integration of the new ballistic strategy with the existing system
