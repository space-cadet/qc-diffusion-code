## Focus Task
C5a: Random Walk Architecture Planning
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 45 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### C5a: Random Walk Architecture Planning
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Created comprehensive UI interface specification with ASCII layouts for main interface, history panel, and replay controls
- Documented component structure, parameter controls, and data export functionality
- Selected dnd-kit framework for UI prototyping and interactive parameter controls
- Added UI design specification file `random-walk-ui-interface.md`
**Status Change**: Research phase â†’ UI design complete

## Files Modified
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/random-walk-ui-interface.md` - Created comprehensive UI design specification
- `memory-bank/tasks/C5a.md` - Updated progress and added UI framework decision
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated task status and file references

## Key Decisions Made
- Selected dnd-kit for UI prototyping to enable drag-and-drop parameter adjustment
- Designed history management system with VCR-style replay controls
- Planned data export functionality with multiple formats (CSV, JSON, HDF5)
- Established component structure integrating with existing React architecture

## Context for Next Session
UI interface design complete. Ready to proceed with implementation planning phase focusing on TypeScript architecture for CTRW physics engine and React component integration strategy.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Design PhysicsRandomWalk class structure with collision mechanisms
2. Plan React component integration strategy with dnd-kit
3. Create detailed implementation phases and timeline
