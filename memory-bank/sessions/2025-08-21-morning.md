## Focus Task

C5a: Random Walk Architecture Planning
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 45 minutes

## Tasks Worked On

### C5a: Random Walk Architecture Planning

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Created comprehensive UI interface specification with ASCII layouts for main interface, history panel, and replay controls
- Documented component structure, parameter controls, and data export functionality
- Selected dnd-kit framework for UI prototyping and interactive parameter controls
- Added UI design specification file `random-walk-ui-interface.md`
  **Status Change**: Research phase â†’ UI design complete

## Files Modified

- `memory-bank/implementation-details/random-walk-ui-interface.md` - Created comprehensive UI design specification
- `memory-bank/tasks/C5a.md` - Updated progress and added UI framework decision
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated task status and file references

## Key Decisions Made

- Selected dnd-kit for UI prototyping to enable drag-and-drop parameter adjustment
- Designed history management system with VCR-style replay controls
- Planned data export functionality with multiple formats (CSV, JSON, HDF5)
- Established component structure integrating with existing React architecture

## Context for Next Session

UI interface design complete. Ready to proceed with implementation planning phase focusing on TypeScript architecture for CTRW physics engine and React component integration strategy.

### C5b: Random Walk UI Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Progress Made**:

- Added react-grid-layout dependency and created GridLayoutPage component
- Implemented 6-panel grid layout matching specification (parameters, canvas, density, history, replay, export)
- Created parameter panel with particle count dropdown and collision rate/jump length/velocity sliders
- Added simulation control buttons (Start/Pause/Reset) with proper state management
- Implemented status display showing simulation state, time, and collision count
- Added derived parameter calculations (diffusion constant, mean free path, mean wait time)
- Created placeholder areas for particle canvas and density comparison chart
- Integrated third "Grid Layout" tab in main navigation
  **Status Change**: New task â†’ UI framework complete

## Files Modified (Updated)

- `memory-bank/implementation-details/random-walk-ui-interface.md` - Created comprehensive UI design specification
- `memory-bank/tasks/C5a.md` - Updated progress and added UI framework decision
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated task status and file references
- `frontend/src/GridLayoutPage.tsx` - Created complete grid layout implementation with parameter controls
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added third tab navigation for grid layout
- `memory-bank/tasks/C5b.md` - Created new task for UI implementation

## Key Decisions Made (Updated)

- Selected dnd-kit for UI prototyping to enable drag-and-drop parameter adjustment
- Designed history management system with VCR-style replay controls
- Planned data export functionality with multiple formats (CSV, JSON, HDF5)
- Established component structure integrating with existing React architecture
- Implemented react-grid-layout for draggable/resizable panel system
- Created functional parameter controls ready for physics engine integration

## Session Extension: State Persistence Enhancement

**Time Extended**: 2025-08-21 08:26:27 IST
**Focus**: Application-wide state persistence and UI improvements

### C1: Numerical Simulations - State Persistence

**Progress Made**:

- Implemented Zustand store with localStorage persistence for application state
- Added separate state slices for PDE simulation and Grid Layout parameters
- Enhanced user experience with seamless session continuity across browser refresh
- Created clean separation between persistent configuration and transient runtime state

### C5b: Random Walk UI - Enhanced Interaction

**Progress Made**:

- Implemented title-bar only dragging using draggableHandle=".drag-handle"
- Connected Grid Layout parameters to Zustand store for persistence
- Enhanced user experience preventing accidental panel movement during control interaction
- Added cursor-move visual feedback for draggable title bars

## Additional Files Modified

- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Created Zustand store with persistence middleware
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Replaced useState with Zustand store integration
- `frontend/src/GridLayoutPage.tsx` - Connected to store and restricted dragging to title bars

## Context for Next Session

Complete application state persistence implemented. Grid layout UI enhanced with title-bar dragging restriction. Ready for physics engine integration and particle visualization implementation.

## Next Session Priorities

1. Integrate CTRW physics engine with parameter controls
2. Implement tsParticles for real-time particle visualization
3. Connect telegraph equation solver for density comparison
4. Add panel collapse/expand functionality
