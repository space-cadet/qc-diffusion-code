## Focus Task
C16: GPU.IO Framework Implementation with Rendering Engine Abstraction
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Phase 1.5 (UI Integration Issues)
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

## Tasks Worked On

### C16: GPU.IO Framework Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- **Issue Diagnosis**: Identified GPU simulation position updates not working due to broken particle sync and API misuse
- **tsParticles API Fixes**: Fixed particle access using `particles.get(i)` instead of array indexing to resolve TypeScript errors
- **Coordinate Mapping Implementation**: Added `setCanvasMapper()` method for physics-to-canvas coordinate transformation
- **Synchronization Robustness**: Added container readiness checks, throttled logging, defensive validation in `syncToTsParticles`
- **Initialization Timing**: Fixed GPU manager creation timing to wait for container readiness with particles
- **Late Binding Support**: Added render-loop mapper binding for cases where simulator becomes available after GPU init
- **UI Integration Analysis**: Discovered critical disconnection between GPU simulation and UI controls
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ Phase 2 â†’ ðŸ”„ Phase 1.5 (UI Integration blocking Phase 2)

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/gpu/GPUParticleManager.ts` - Enhanced sync with coordinate mapping, throttled logging, defensive checks
- `frontend/src/hooks/useParticlesLoader.ts` - Fixed initialization timing and late mapper binding
- `frontend/src/config/tsParticlesConfig.ts` - Corrected tsParticles API usage to fix TypeScript errors
- `memory-bank/tasks/C16.md` - Updated status and added Phase 1.5 for UI integration fixes
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated master task status reflecting UI integration issues

## Key Decisions Made
- **Phase 1.5 Addition**: Added intermediate phase to fix UI integration before proceeding to collision physics
- **Coordinate Mapping Strategy**: Use existing ParticleManager's `mapToCanvas()` method for consistency with CPU path
- **Sync Robustness**: Throttled logging and defensive validation to handle edge cases in GPU-CPU sync
- **Initialization Approach**: Delay GPU manager creation until container is ready rather than handle empty state

## Critical Issues Identified
**GPU-UI Integration Breakdown**: GPU simulation completely disconnected from UI control flow
1. **Reset/Initialize**: UI controls only work with CPU simulator, don't affect GPU state
2. **Parameter Updates**: GPU manager ignores physics parameter changes from UI
3. **Metrics Tracking**: Time/collision stats only come from CPU simulator in GPU mode  
4. **State Snapshots**: Periodic saves only capture CPU state, not GPU state
5. **Lifecycle Management**: GPU manager created once, never updated/recreated

## Context for Next Session
**CRITICAL**: GPU simulation now works (position updates, coordinate mapping, sync) but is completely isolated from UI controls. User can toggle GPU mode and see particles moving, but reset/initialize/parameter changes have no effect on GPU simulation.

## Next Session Priorities
1. **GPU Reset/Initialize Methods**: Add reset() and reinitialize() methods to GPUParticleManager
2. **Parameter Update Handling**: GPU manager updateParameters() method and parameter change detection
3. **GPU Metrics Integration**: Track time/collision stats from GPU simulation in UI
4. **State Snapshot Integration**: Save/restore GPU state in periodic snapshots
5. **GPU Lifecycle Management**: Recreate GPU manager when parameters require it

**Estimated**: ~180 lines across 3-4 files to add parallel GPU paths to existing CPU control flows
