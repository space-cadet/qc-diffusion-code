## Focus Task

C1: Numerical Simulations for QC-Diffusion Paper Concepts
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 65 minutes total

## Tasks Worked On

### C0: Code Subproject Memory Bank Initialization

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Initialized v6.8 memory bank templates for code subproject
- Examined main project memory bank for code-related task history
- Migrated T9 and T9a tasks to new numbering scheme (C1, C2)
- Created individual task files with complete development history
- Updated all core memory bank files with proper timestamps
- Established independent task tracking system
  **Status Change**: NEW â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

### C1: Numerical Simulations for QC-Diffusion Paper Concepts

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Implemented backend-agnostic frontend architecture
- Created `utils/initialConditions.ts` for local initial condition generation
- Refactored App.tsx to remove backend dependencies from controls
- Made WebSocket connections conditional on solver type
- Fixed CORS issues by eliminating unnecessary backend calls
- **COMPLETED Phase 4: Multi-equation selection system with organized UI**
- Implemented equation selection checkboxes grouped with respective parameters
- Added conditional parameter display (only show when equation selected)
- Created dynamic type system supporting any combination of equations
- Built multi-solver parallel execution for selected equations
- Added dynamic trace generation with automatic colors and legends
- Verified shared initial distribution across all selected equations
  **Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (Phase 4 completed, ready for Phase 5)

## Files Modified

- `tasks.md` - Updated task registry with C0, C1, C2 and new numbering scheme
- `tasks/C0.md` - Created memory bank initialization task file
- `tasks/C1.md` - Created numerical simulations task file (migrated from T9)
- `tasks/C2.md` - Created WebGL solver integration task file (migrated from T9a)
- `session_cache.md` - Updated with current session and task registry
- `edit_history.md` - Added migration and initialization entries
- `frontend/src/utils/initialConditions.ts` - Created local initial condition generator
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Refactored to be backend-agnostic
- `implementation-details/visual-pde-gpu-solver-plan.md` - Added multi-equation selection plan
- `frontend/src/Controls.tsx` - Reorganized UI with equation selection and parameter grouping
- `frontend/src/types.ts` - Added dynamic equation type system with metadata
- `frontend/src/hooks/useWebGLSolver.ts` - Multi-solver parallel execution system
- `frontend/src/webgl/webgl-solver.js` - Extensible equation shader system
- `frontend/src/PlotComponent.tsx` - Dynamic trace generation for selected equations

## Key Decisions Made

- Adopted separate task numbering scheme (C0, C1, C2) for code subproject
- Migrated complete development history from main project memory bank
- Maintained technical context and implementation details in task files
- Established independent memory bank following v6.8 standards
- **Implemented equation-centric UI organization with parameters grouped under equations**
- **Used Map-based multi-solver architecture for extensible equation support**
- **Created dynamic type system to support any combination of equation selections**

## Context for Next Session

Phase 4 multi-equation selection system completed with organized UI and extensible architecture. System ready for Wheeler-DeWitt equation implementation (Phase 5). All equations share same initial distribution and the interface supports flexible equation combinations.

## Next Session Priorities

1. Implement Phase 5: Wheeler-DeWitt equation implementation as additional equation type
2. Performance benchmarking between py-pde and WebGL solvers
3. Begin random walk and spin network model development
