## Focus Task

C0: Code Subproject Memory Bank Initialization
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: 18 minutes

## Tasks Worked On

### C0: Code Subproject Memory Bank Initialization

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Initialized v6.8 memory bank templates for code subproject
- Examined main project memory bank for code-related task history
- Migrated T9 and T9a tasks to new numbering scheme (C1, C2)
- Created individual task files with complete development history
- Updated all core memory bank files with proper timestamps
- Established independent task tracking system
  **Status Change**: NEW â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

### C1: Numerical Simulations for QC-Diffusion Paper Concepts

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Implemented backend-agnostic frontend architecture
- Created `utils/initialConditions.ts` for local initial condition generation
- Refactored App.tsx to remove backend dependencies from controls
- Made WebSocket connections conditional on solver type
- Fixed CORS issues by eliminating unnecessary backend calls
- Updated implementation plan for multi-equation selection system
  **Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (continued)

## Files Modified

- `tasks.md` - Updated task registry with C0, C1, C2 and new numbering scheme
- `tasks/C0.md` - Created memory bank initialization task file
- `tasks/C1.md` - Created numerical simulations task file (migrated from T9)
- `tasks/C2.md` - Created WebGL solver integration task file (migrated from T9a)
- `session_cache.md` - Updated with current session and task registry
- `edit_history.md` - Added migration and initialization entries
- `frontend/src/utils/initialConditions.ts` - Created local initial condition generator
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Refactored to be backend-agnostic
- `implementation-details/visual-pde-gpu-solver-plan.md` - Added multi-equation selection plan

## Key Decisions Made

- Adopted separate task numbering scheme (C0, C1, C2) for code subproject
- Migrated complete development history from main project memory bank
- Maintained technical context and implementation details in task files
- Established independent memory bank following v6.8 standards

## Context for Next Session

Code subproject memory bank fully initialized with migrated task history. C1 (numerical simulations) ready for continued development with Phase 2 Wheeler-DeWitt implementations. C2 (WebGL solver) completed and available for performance optimization.

## Next Session Priorities

1. Implement C1 Phase 4: Multi-equation selection system
2. Continue C1 Phase 2: Wheeler-DeWitt equation implementations
3. Performance benchmarking between py-pde and WebGL solvers
