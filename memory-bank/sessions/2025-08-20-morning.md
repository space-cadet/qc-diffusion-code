## Focus Task

T1: Numerical Simulations for QC-Diffusion Paper Concepts
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 115 minutes total

## Tasks Worked On

### T0: Code Subproject Memory Bank Initialization

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Initialized v6.8 memory bank templates for code subproject
- Examined main project memory bank for code-related task history
- Migrated T9 and T9a tasks to new numbering scheme (T1, T2)
- Created individual task files with complete development history
- Updated all core memory bank files with proper timestamps
- Established independent task tracking system
  **Status Change**: NEW → ✅ COMPLETED

### T1: Numerical Simulations for QC-Diffusion Paper Concepts

**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:

- Implemented backend-agnostic frontend architecture
- Created `utils/initialConditions.ts` for local initial condition generation
- Refactored App.tsx to remove backend dependencies from controls
- Made WebSocket connections conditional on solver type
- Fixed CORS issues by eliminating unnecessary backend calls
- **COMPLETED Phase 4: Multi-equation selection system with organized UI**
- Implemented equation selection checkboxes grouped with respective parameters
- Added conditional parameter display (only show when equation selected)
- Created dynamic type system supporting any combination of equations
- Built multi-solver parallel execution for selected equations
- Added dynamic trace generation with automatic colors and legends
- Verified shared initial distribution across all selected equations
- **COMPLETED Phase 5: Telegraph equation stability fixes and conservation monitoring**
- Fixed numerical instability in telegraph equation WebGL shader implementation
- Corrected telegraph equation to proper first-order system: du/dt = w, dw/dt = v²∇²u - 2aw
- Added velocity parameter v to shader uniform declarations
- Implemented comprehensive conservation monitoring system with real-time tracking
- Enhanced WebGL solver to extract both u and w fields for proper energy calculation
- Created ConservationMonitor class with mass and energy conservation tracking
- Added conservation error monitoring with stability indicators and tolerance checking
- Reorganized UI layout with simulation controls positioned directly below plot
  **Status Change**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Phase 5 completed, ready for Phase 6)

## Files Modified

## Key Decisions Made

- Adopted separate task numbering scheme (T0, T1, T2) for code subproject
- Migrated complete development history from main project memory bank
- Maintained technical context and implementation details in task files
- Established independent memory bank following v6.8 standards
- **Implemented equation-centric UI organization with parameters grouped under equations**
- **Used Map-based multi-solver architecture for extensible equation support**
- **Created dynamic type system to support any combination of equation selections**
- **Fixed telegraph equation numerical instability with proper first-order system formulation**
- **Implemented comprehensive conservation monitoring for both mass and energy conservation**
- **Enhanced UI layout with controls positioned below plot for better accessibility**

## Context for Next Session

Phase 5 telegraph equation stability and conservation monitoring completed. Telegraph equation now uses proper physics with corrected first-order system formulation. Conservation monitoring provides real-time stability assessment with mass and energy conservation tracking. UI reorganized for better accessibility with controls below plot. System ready for Wheeler-DeWitt equation implementation (Phase 6).

## Next Session Priorities

1. Implement Phase 6: Wheeler-DeWitt equation implementation as additional equation type
2. Test conservation monitoring system with different initial conditions and parameter ranges
3. Begin random walk and spin network model development
4. Performance optimization for conservation calculations
