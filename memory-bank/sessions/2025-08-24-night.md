## Focus Task
C7: Observer Design and Implementation
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Time Spent**: 45 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### C7: Observer Design and Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Implemented `KineticEnergyObservable.ts` with comprehensive kinetic energy calculations including total, average, max, min values
- Implemented `MomentumObservable.ts` with total momentum vector calculations and component tracking
- Implemented `MSDObservable.ts` with mean squared displacement from initial positions and diffusion analysis
- Updated `ObservablesPanel.tsx` with full UI integration for all three new observables
- Added `showMSD` to app store state interface and default configuration
- Integrated registration/unregistration lifecycle for new observables
- Added minimal console logging to observables for debugging and monitoring
**Status Change**: Substantially advanced â†’ Near completion

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/physics/observables/KineticEnergyObservable.ts` - Created comprehensive kinetic energy observable with statistical analysis methods
- `frontend/src/physics/observables/MomentumObservable.ts` - Created momentum tracking observable with vector calculations
- `frontend/src/physics/observables/MSDObservable.ts` - Created mean squared displacement observable with diffusion coefficient analysis
- `frontend/src/components/ObservablesPanel.tsx` - Added UI integration for kinetic energy, momentum, and MSD observables
- `frontend/src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added showMSD to RandomWalkUIState interface and default state

## Key Decisions Made
- Implemented three core observables for comprehensive physics analysis rather than completing one at a time
- Added statistical analysis methods to each observable for future moment calculations
- Included minimal console logging for debugging without performance impact
- Used consistent UI patterns across all observables for user experience consistency
- Maintained temporal consistency and lazy evaluation patterns established in previous observer work

## Context for Next Session
Observer pattern implementation now includes four comprehensive observables: particle count, kinetic energy, momentum, and MSD. KineticEnergyObservable revealed that particles maintain constant speeds (~1250 KE each), confirming ballistic motion physics. MomentumObservable tracks system momentum conservation. MSDObservable measures particle spreading for telegraph equation verification. All observables include history tracking, statistical methods, and are fully integrated with UI lifecycle.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Performance testing with multiple active observables to verify zero overhead design
2. Add statistical moment calculation methods to existing observables for advanced analysis
3. Implement CSV data export functionality for external analysis tools
4. Test observable behavior during simulation state transitions (start/pause/reset)
