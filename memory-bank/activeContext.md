## Current Focus
**Task**: C21 Build Loop Resolution and Monorepo Root Configuration
**Status**: Completed - Vercel build loop fixed, root vercel.json configured, memory bank updated
**Priority**: CRITICAL

## Immediate Context
Session focused on resolving critical Vercel build loop issue and updating monorepo deployment configuration. Fixed recursive build commands by moving vercel.json to project root and explicitly defining build sequences. All memory bank files updated with latest implementation details and timestamps.

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 13 (C1, C2a, C2b, C3, C7, C7a, C8, C12, C15, C15a, C16, C17, META-1, META-2)
- Completed Tasks: 13 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C9, C10, C13, C14, C21, C24, C5b)
- Current Focus: Memory bank maintenance and documentation updates
- Repository Status: Deployed to Vercel, standalone repository active
- Technical State: Vercel build pipeline fully functional, quantum walk explorer fully implemented with unified styling
- Architecture Analysis: React component approach chosen over class-based architecture
- Next Action: Continue with other active tasks or await new development requests

## Recent Completed Work
- C21: Build and Dependency Resolution - Vercel deployment fixes, monorepo build pipeline, TypeScript errors, JSX parsing resolution, build loop fix, root vercel.json configuration
- C24: Quantum Walk Explorer Implementation - Full React component with parameter panel, classical comparison, decoherence logic, and unified styling
- Memory bank documentation updated following protocol with proper timestamps and file structure
- Implementation details documentation created with comprehensive technical reference
