## Current Focus
**Task**: C21b expr-eval Security Vulnerability Mitigation Complete
**Status**: Active - Security hardening implementation and documentation complete
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Evening session completed comprehensive security hardening for expr-eval vulnerabilities through input validation and runtime protection. Memory bank updated with new task C21b, implementation documentation, and security mitigation details. Build verification successful with all security measures in place.

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 14 (C1, C2a, C2b, C3, C7, C7a, C8, C12, C15, C15a, C16, C17, C25, META-1, META-2)
- Completed Tasks: 15 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C9, C10, C13, C14, C21, C21b, C24)
- Current Focus: Security vulnerability mitigation complete and documented
- Repository Status: Successfully deploying to Vercel with proper monorepo workspace protocol and security hardening
- Technical State: Build pipeline fully functional, security vulnerabilities mitigated, expr-eval safe for production use
- Architecture Analysis: Multi-layered security validation implemented
- Next Action: Complete edit history and session documentation

## Recent Completed Work
- C21b expr-eval Security Vulnerability Mitigation complete - comprehensive input validation and runtime protection implemented
- C21 Build and Dependency Vulnerability Resolution complete - workspace protocol migration successful
- Git submodules removed (DynamicalBilliards.jl, visual-pde, ts-quantum) and converted to local packages
- Frontend dependencies converted from file: to workspace:* protocol for proper monorepo management
- Build output standardized - CJS .cjs extension, ESM .js extension with dual package configuration
- Vercel deployment fully functional with proper dependency resolution
- Implementation documentation created: monorepo-workspace-protocol.md and expr-eval-security-hardening.md
- Memory bank template compliance achieved across all updates
