## Current Focus
**Task**: C25 Random Walk Page Architecture Review and Fix
**Status**: Active - Comprehensive architecture review complete, 31 issues identified, ready for implementation
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Evening session focused on updating memory bank documentation for uncommitted RandomWalkSim architecture changes. Implementation docs and task files updated with current session progress, including architecture review integration, file modifications, and key improvements. Ready to proceed with remaining memory bank updates.

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 14 (C1, C2a, C2b, C3, C7, C7a, C8, C12, C15, C15a, C16, C17, C25, META-1, META-2)
- Completed Tasks: 13 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C9, C10, C13, C14, C21, C24)
- Current Focus: C25 Random Walk architecture review - implementation docs and task files updated
- Repository Status: Deployed to Vercel, standalone repository active
- Technical State: Vercel build pipeline fully functional, quantum walk explorer fully implemented with unified styling
- Architecture Analysis: React component approach chosen over class-based architecture
- Next Action: Complete memory bank updates (session cache, edit history, tasks registry)

## Recent Completed Work
- C25 Random Walk architecture review complete - 31 issues identified across 7-phase systematic review
- Complete documentation suite created: review findings, action items, implementation plan, tracking
- Implementation docs updated with current session progress (random-walk-simulator-refactor.md, gpu-io-implementation-plan.md, gpu-ctrw-strategy-implementation.md)
- Task files updated with architecture review integration (C25.md, C16.md, C16a.md, C5b.md, C5c.md, C6a.md)
- All staged files updated with proper timestamps in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS IST format
- Memory bank template compliance achieved across all files
- Evening session memory bank documentation updates in progress
