## Current Focus
**Task**: C2a/C2b (PDE Solver Methods and Boundary Conditions Implementation)
**Status**: Multiple active high-priority tasks in parallel development
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Advanced QC-diffusion simulation system with WebGL GPU-accelerated PDE solver supporting multiple boundary condition types. Successfully implemented solver-agnostic Dirichlet boundary condition enforcement using post-processing approach. Fixed Forward Euler solver rendering issue and enhanced plot visualization with solver and parameter information.

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 9 (C1, C2, C2a, C2b, C3, C5, C5a, C5c, C7, C12, META-1)
- Completed Tasks: 8 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C8, C9, C10)
- Current Focus Areas: Boundary condition implementation, PDE solver methods, UI enhancements
- Repository Status: Deployed to Vercel, standalone GitHub repository created
- Technical State: Dirichlet boundary conditions implemented with post-processing approach
- Next Priorities: Boundary condition UI selection system, additional BC types (Periodic, Absorbing), per-equation solver selection UI, RK4 solver implementation
