## Current Focus
**Task**: C25 Random Walk Page Architecture Review and Fix
**Status**: Active - Comprehensive architecture review complete, 31 issues identified, ready for implementation
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Session focused on completing comprehensive Random Walk page architecture review identifying 31 issues (3 critical, 12 high, 13 medium, 3 low). Created complete documentation suite including review findings, action items, implementation plan, and tracking. All files updated with proper timestamps and template compliance. Ready to proceed with critical bug fixes (C25a).

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 14 (C1, C2a, C2b, C3, C7, C7a, C8, C12, C15, C15a, C16, C17, C25, META-1, META-2)
- Completed Tasks: 13 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C9, C10, C13, C14, C21, C24)
- Current Focus: C25 Random Walk architecture review complete, ready for critical bug fixes
- Repository Status: Deployed to Vercel, standalone repository active
- Technical State: Vercel build pipeline fully functional, quantum walk explorer fully implemented with unified styling
- Architecture Analysis: React component approach chosen over class-based architecture
- Next Action: Proceed with C25a critical bug fixes (Graph physics GPU, Replay controls, Animation race condition)

## Recent Completed Work
- C25 Random Walk architecture review complete - 31 issues identified across 7-phase systematic review
- Complete documentation suite created: review findings, action items, implementation plan, tracking
- All staged files updated with proper timestamps in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS IST format
- Memory bank template compliance achieved across all files
- Ready to proceed with C25a critical bug fixes (P3-006, P1-011, P1-007)
