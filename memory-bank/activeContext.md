## Current Focus
**Task**: C27 Simulation Lab Framework Implementation
**Status**: Active - Core components and demo page complete
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Completed implementation of Simulation Lab Framework core components and demo page. All interfaces (SimulationController, TimeSeriesStore), components (MetricsGrid, TimelineSlider, ControlButtons), hook (useSimulation), and service (ExportService) are implemented with diagnostic logging. Demo page showcases all framework capabilities. Framework is ready for migration of existing simulation pages. Build verified successfully.

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 15 (C1, C2a, C2b, C3, C7, C7a, C8, C12, C15, C15a, C16, C17, C25, C27, META-1, META-2)
- Completed Tasks: 15 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C9, C10, C13, C14, C21, C21b, C24, C26)
- Current Focus: C27 Framework implementation and migration planning
- Repository Status: Successfully deploying to Vercel
- Technical State: Build pipeline functional, core framework components implemented
- Implementation Status: All 7 framework components (2 interfaces, 3 components, 1 hook, 1 service) complete
- Next Action: Migrate QuantumWalkPage to use framework components
