## Current Focus
**Task**: C24 (Quantum Random Walk Page Implementation)
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Implemented a high-performance 1D Quantum Random Walk visualization using the `ts-quantum` library. The simulation features real-time Plotly.js charts, parameter controls, and quantum observables (mean, variance). Performance was optimized by introducing native `SparseOperator` support in `ts-quantum`.

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 12 (C1, C2a, C2b, C3, C7, C7a, C8, C12, C15, C15a, C16, C17, META-1, META-2)
- Completed Tasks: 12 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C9, C10, C13, C14, C5b, C24)
- Current Focus: Physics engine runtime switching, execution flow analysis
- Repository Status: Deployed to Vercel, standalone repository active
- Technical State: Physics engine toggle implemented with state persistence
- Architecture Analysis: Complete execution chain mapping for legacy vs new engine paths completed
- Next Action: Debug missing console logs in legacy engine execution path
