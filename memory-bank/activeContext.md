## Current Focus
**Task**: Memory Bank Documentation Update - C21 Workspace Protocol Migration Complete
**Status**: Active - Documenting successful build resolution and deployment
**Priority**: MEDIUM

## Immediate Context
Evening session focused on documenting today's critical workspace protocol migration that resolved build inconsistencies and enabled successful Vercel deployment. Memory bank updates in progress including task C21 completion, implementation detail documentation, and session cache updates.

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 14 (C1, C2a, C2b, C3, C7, C7a, C8, C12, C15, C15a, C16, C17, C25, META-1, META-2)
- Completed Tasks: 14 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C9, C10, C13, C14, C21, C24)
- Current Focus: Memory bank documentation for workspace protocol migration success
- Repository Status: Successfully deploying to Vercel with proper monorepo workspace protocol
- Technical State: Build pipeline fully functional, git submodules removed, workspace:* protocol implemented
- Architecture Analysis: Monorepo dependency management standardized
- Next Action: Complete edit history and session documentation

## Recent Completed Work
- C21 Build and Dependency Vulnerability Resolution complete - workspace protocol migration successful
- Git submodules removed (DynamicalBilliards.jl, visual-pde, ts-quantum) and converted to local packages
- Frontend dependencies converted from file: to workspace:* protocol for proper monorepo management
- Build output standardized - CJS .cjs extension, ESM .js extension with dual package configuration
- Vercel deployment fully functional with proper dependency resolution
- Implementation documentation created: monorepo-workspace-protocol.md with lessons learned
- Memory bank template compliance achieved across all updates
