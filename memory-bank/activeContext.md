## Current Focus
**Task**: C28 Simplicial Growth Code Verification and Memory Bank Update
**Status**: Active - Verified code changes, correcting documentation discrepancies
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Verified actual simplicial growth implementation against summary claims. All code changes confirmed correct: Dimension type (2|3), vertexPositions, dimension-aware initialization, 2D Pachner moves, PachnerMoveTester component, stored geometric positions. Task files C28a, C28b, C28c, C28d created as planned. Documentation discrepancy identified: summary claims 4 new implementation docs created, but only 2 exist (original simplicial-growth-algorithm.md and simplicial-growth-ui-architecture.md). Updating memory bank with accurate information.

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 16 (C1, C2a, C2b, C3, C7, C7a, C8, C12, C15, C15a, C16, C17, C25, C27, C28, META-1, META-2)
- Completed Tasks: 15 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C9, C10, C13, C14, C21, C21b, C24, C26)
- Current Focus: C28 code verification complete, memory bank updates in progress
- Repository Status: Successfully deploying to Vercel
- Technical State: Build pipeline functional, simplicial growth implementation complete
- Implementation Status: C28 code verified, documentation being corrected
- Next Action: Complete memory bank updates, verify consistency across all files

## Recent Completed Work
- C28 Code Verification: Verified all code changes from summary match actual implementation
- C28 Documentation Correction: Updated C28.md with correct implementation doc references
- Memory Bank Updates: Updated edit_history.md, session_cache.md, created 2026-01-29-morning.md session
- C28 Task Files: C28a, C28b, C28c, C28d confirmed created and properly structured
- Session Files: Created new session file documenting verification work
