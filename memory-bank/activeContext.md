## Current Focus
**Task**: C12 (Interparticle Collisions and Obstacles Implementation)
**Status**: Multiple active high-priority tasks in parallel development
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Advanced QC-diffusion simulation system with random walk physics, telegraph equation verification, and comprehensive UI framework. Project successfully deployed to Vercel with standalone repository. Ready to implement realistic particle-particle collisions and arbitrary obstacle geometries using Matter.js/Rapier.js physics engines.

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 9 (C1, C2, C3, C5, C5a, C5c, C7, C12, META-1)
- Completed Tasks: 8 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C8, C9, C10)
- Current Focus Areas: Physics engine integration, obstacle implementation, particle collision detection
- Repository Status: Deployed to Vercel, standalone GitHub repository created
- Technical State: Implementation plan completed for Matter.js/Rapier.js integration
- Next Priorities: Matter.js integration, MatterCTRWStrategy implementation, obstacle creation tools
