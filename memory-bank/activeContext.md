## Current Focus
**Task**: C27 Simulation Lab Framework Design
**Status**: Active - Architecture design and documentation in progress
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Night session initiated C27 to design shared simulation lab infrastructure for PDE, Classical Walk, and Quantum Walk pages. Analyzed existing codebase for reusable components (FloatingPanel, PlotlyChart, TextObservable DSL) and identified missing abstractions (SimulationController, unified history/replay). Created architecture design with ASCII diagrams showing data flow and component relationships.

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 15 (C1, C2a, C2b, C3, C7, C7a, C8, C12, C15, C15a, C16, C17, C25, C27, META-1, META-2)
- Completed Tasks: 15 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C9, C10, C13, C14, C21, C21b, C24, C26)
- Current Focus: C27 Simulation Lab Framework architecture design
- Repository Status: Successfully deploying to Vercel
- Technical State: Build pipeline functional, design phase for shared simulation infrastructure
- Architecture Analysis: SimulationController interface and TimeSeriesStore designed
- Next Action: Begin implementation of core interfaces

## Recent Completed Work
- C27 task created for Simulation Lab Framework
- Architecture design doc created: simulation-lab-framework.md with ASCII diagrams
- Analyzed existing reusable components and identified extraction targets
- C21b expr-eval Security Vulnerability Mitigation complete
- C26 Build Performance Optimization complete
