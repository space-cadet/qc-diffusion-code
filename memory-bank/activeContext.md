## Current Focus
**Task**: C15 (Physics Engine Architecture Migration)
**Status**: Runtime UI toggle implementation for physics engine selection
**Priority**: HIGH

## Immediate Context
Implementing runtime toggle button for switching between legacy and new physics engines on random walk page. Added useNewEngine state to app store and modified RandomWalkSimulator constructor to accept engine flag parameter. Toggle button placed in page header with visual feedback (LEGACY/NEW states).

## Current Working State
- Active Tasks: 12 (C1, C2a, C2b, C3, C7, C7a, C8, C12, C15, C15a, C16, C17, META-1, META-2)
- Completed Tasks: 11 (C0, C4, C5b, C6, C6a, C9, C10, C13, C14, C5b)
- Current Focus: Physics engine runtime switching, execution flow analysis
- Repository Status: Deployed to Vercel, standalone repository active
- Technical State: Physics engine toggle implemented with state persistence
- Architecture Analysis: Complete execution chain mapping for legacy vs new engine paths completed
- Next Action: Debug missing console logs in legacy engine execution path
