## Commit Message

```
refactor: simplify boundary system and enhance strategy interfaces

- Remove CoordinateSystem dependency from BoundaryManager and boundaryUtils
- Simplify BoundaryManager constructor to take only BoundaryConfig
- Enhance CompositeStrategy with PhysicsStrategy interface support
- Improve collision detection with per-particle radius calculations
- Remove legacy boundary handling code from collision strategies
- Streamline strategy interfaces and remove duplicate methods

Files modified:
- frontend/src/physics/core/BoundaryManager.ts
- frontend/src/physics/utils/boundaryUtils.ts
- frontend/src/physics/strategies/*.ts (8 files)

## Technical Summary

**Architecture Simplification**
- Removed coordinate system complexity from boundary handling
- Eliminated code duplication across strategy files
- Streamlined strategy interfaces for cleaner implementation

**Collision System Improvements**
- Enhanced collision detection with proper per-particle radius handling
- Removed legacy collision methods and duplicate boundary application
- Improved strategy interface consistency

**Files Changed**: 8 strategy files, 2 core physics files
**Lines Modified**: ~200+ lines across boundary and collision systems
**Impact**: Simplified architecture, reduced code duplication, enhanced collision detection
